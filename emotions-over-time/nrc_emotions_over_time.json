    "paragraph": "Having been some time impressed with the belief that a trip to California would be beneficial not only in a pecuniary point of view, but likewise to the better regulation of health and future happenings, I resolved about the 1st of January of 1849 to have my profession that of a Mathematical Instrument Maker and the eve to be remembered Monumental city of Baltimore for a trip to the golden shores of the far western El Dorado. Circumstances favoring, I made preparations in Philadelphia presuming that my trip thither would be made by sea around Cape Horn a distance of 7000 miles in the Ship \"Mason\" which advertised to leave that port several times fixing definite days of departure. Mr W.H. Ogden called upon me requesting my naming in forming a company then to be limited to 10 or 15 select gentlemen. I consented and gave my name as one of the party them numbering three, whose names were W. H. Ogden, B Jay Antrim and W Middleton, the latter of whom had since resigned and remained at his residence in New Jersey. Mr Ogden and myself drew up a notice at Mr Bonsals' Book Store, at No 33 1/2 Market Street, Philadelphia and inserted the same in the \"Ledger,\" and \"North American.\" The advertisment requesting all desirous of making a speedy and an agreeable journey via Matamoras, Monterey, Saltileo, Durango and Mazatlan to California to address \"Camargo,\" at the office's of those two respective papers, which was soon followed by a number of applicants; who were severally visited by Mr Ogden and myself. Mr Jones, of 6th Street, being the first of that number added to our list. We soon procured a room for meeting at No 100 Chestnut Street through the kindness Majors Collins and Ross, where we met in harmony and concert of action until we had completed our company and extended the number of the same to Forty. At one of the Meetings, the name of \"Camargo Company\" was adopted, which is the name of a Mexican town, to which we were first destined from Philadelphia, by sea, and from thence after having procured there our outfit of mules provissions & to proceed overland to Mazatlan via the abovementioned route. Old resolutions adopted in our \"Camargo\" meetings limiting our numbers were several times rescinded and new ones were adopted until our number had increased to forty as before mentioned & Committees of Camp Equipage, provissions, pasports, protections, for chartering a vessel &c all of whoom acted and reported accordingly. Having ascertained that the abovenamed route was infested with hoards of warlike and savage Camanchee Indians, who were committing outrages and massacring those found in their way, and that the same route was in consequence very dangerous, and believing it rash, as also influenced by friends, I withdrew my name from that route, and proposed the Tampico route to the company as the safest, most pleasant, and a shorter land distance than the former; which then being unfavorably received, I withdrew by advice, and my own impressions of that course, and then prepared to proceed around by Cape Horn. In the mien time, the company adopted the Tampico route via San Louis Potosi &c. and —Mr. Ogden called upon me to inform me of it and his desire with many of my old friends was that I should return to the company: and as they had changed the rout to the one I thought most prefferable, I again added my name. Mr Ogden was elected President and myself Secretary of the \"Camargo Company,\" and in my leaving Mr W Robinson, merchant, was elected to supply my place, in which by request and his absence I served several times after my return. A committee appointed chartered the Brig \"Thomas Walters,\" to convey our company of forty to Tampico in Mexico, which was contracted for at $50.00 each, for cabin passage, and the vessel advertised to sail at 8 O Clock A.M. on the 31st of January 1849. Four members declined going with us and three others filled their vacancies. In consequence of some difficulty in entering our articles at the custom house for Mexico, whereby our Captain and vessel was in danger of the laws of Mexico, - our departure was delayed until 9.0.clock A.M. on the following morning the 1st of February. Feb 1st Slight Snow, cold and finally sleety rain; I repaired with all remains of baggage to the vessel at an early hour, and found many congregated to witness our departure. The crowds along the wharves notwithstanding the inclemency of the weather, continued to increase until many hundreds lined the surrounding piers. A few minutes before 9.0.clock our company repaired with arms to two lines upon the Quarter Deck, and fired from guns and pistols a departing salute. Mr Robinson then presented - \"three cheers to our Country\", which our company responded to with warmth - \"three cheers to the friends and dear bonnie lassies, we leave behind,\" and it burst simultaneously from the very hearts of all. - and \"three cheers to Philadelphia\" which we answered appropriately according with our sentiments of the Quaker City. The citizens upon the wharves responded - \"three cheers for the success of the Carmago Company\" followed by a succession of cheers for individuals named in our company, among which the clerk of the Ship \"Mason,\" observing my singular dress in common with my comrades and knowing me, gave \"three cheers for the Buckskin Injnn.\" and thus did our friends cheer us at the hour of separating from all that was dear to us, to embark upon the great and eventful Ocean of future prospects. About, 9.0.clock A.M. the steamboat \"Wave' came beside and before night towed us in co with another vessel as far as New Castle. At New Castle we dropped anchor for the night, and finding a mistake of six packages of provisions which were nescessary for the completion of the captains' manifest for Mexico, it was found requisite to send Mr Thompson, immediately back to Philadelphia in order to bring on the same by express, which he did by an early hour on the following morning, and received a vote of thanks from the company. This evening was spent with considerable spirit and mirth on the part of Messrs Robinson, C. Jones and Bates; which however was excused by the company in general as they were known to be gentleman, and believed to be unaccustomed to such heavy exercises. Besides the leaving of home under the deepest immaginable of melancholly feelings. This day a vote was taken in the affirmative for prohibiting the smoking of cigars in either cabin of the Brig, the quantity of powder and combustibles on board beeing deem'd a sufficient reason. The Roll was called and the following gentlemen answered to their names, --  to wit. Some of our company went on shore at New Castle and made some few purchases of small articles. Have up anchor at an early hour, and got under way towards the breakwater. weather cold and hazy. Proceeded but a short distance this day and cast anchor 2 miles below Reedy Island, in the afternoon where we remained until 4.0.clock the next morning. Weather clear and cold with a North West wind which drove us out the bay in a beautiful and interesting manner with full canvass on a bounding sea. Personal feelings were consulted over the guard in a member of cases, and after, relief expressed. My feelings were much agitated in consequence of the heavy ocean [swells], and I left an elegant dinner of soup and chickens to contemplate the foamingbillows, and returned when convenient to finish the same, which I did in a few minutes with more relish after having cast over a full account much to the relief of my inexpressible feelings. The dinner table was left patronized by our gents than on the day previous, who were also contemplating the foaming billows with the same inexpressible feelings. One instance of inebriation occurred this day which created unpleasant feelings between the captain and said individual, but was amicably settled to the benefit of said person and any of the company, should they in future indulge, which it is presumed they will not doo, as many if not nearly the whole of them, appear to be temperate and sensible men. This evening being much moderated, with a clear and beautiful Moon, most of our party promenade the whole round of the vessel in rapid Military order, whilst the brig bounded upon the long and high Ocean Swells with that majesty becomming the bread bosom of the Atlantic; whilst the spray threw up to the bowsprit and the sheeted sides, it's showery foam, gilded by the silvery rags of the Moon, and followed in the wake  by a long bright trail of foaming ripples receding in our pathway back to the horizon.Our boat dashed on handsomely to the tune of a brisk wind, whilst the music and merry songs of the happier ones arose in concert with the gently whistling winds that playfully tuned their ocean song amid our rigging and canvass. The whole scene was exceedingly  interesting, and the music harmonious,  being sung by good voices, well timed, and filled with the deepest base voice, for a human being that I ever heard, which added greatly to the sweetness of the music; they sang numerous songs that had more richness amid a scene like this, than I had ever before supposed could be the case; I enjoyed it very much. Harmony and quietness prevail generally throughout the cabins, and no discords have occurred this day. A clear, mild, and beautiful morning. I rose early in order to behold the Sun rise over the ocean, which was beautifully decorated  with long light clouds, which partly shaded its disk and gave more glowing colors to the scene; At 10. A.M. a meeting for worship,was called on the after dark, and Revd Mr. Woods,  officiated, assisted by the Revd Mr Blake, nearly each  member attend the meeting; which was conducted  with very creditible solemnity and attention. The  subject was to those who go down upon the great  deep, with a copy of an address delivered by a Revd  gentleman to the young gentleman of Boston, on emigrating  to California, and the choice of good society. A pistol exploded from firing last night, and Mr. Robinson  was cut back of the right shoulder by a piece  at least 5 inches in length, the would though sore  to stay is not however dangerous. This afternoon  many guns and pistols were fired at the little  dog sharks, that are now following our vessel in  numbers; 7 or 8 of which were caught and hauled  on board with fish hooks and lines; they were  usually two feet in length, and bore some resemblance  to the common pike. This afternoon we have  made but little progress, owing to a calm, and  have hardly average 2 knots an hour for half the day,  Towards night clouds arose with sprinkling rain  and there was a general disposition to be in doors. Monday 5th - Up before sunrise and saw the sparkling ocean spray as our galliant boat drove swiftly o'er mountain waves before a fierce gale which changed to a storm by noon, a day long to be remembered by many of our sea sick company. Such a sight all over the Brig, it only kneeds  an old sea faring man to judge of over 30 green ones just ushered to sea in a fierce gale with rain pelting them like so much fine shot; and they bounding sky high on mountain billows. The bounding of our vessel was truly majestic and far beyond what I had ever before witnessed; all sails were tied up and nothing but the small stay sail open to the gale during the afternoon Nearly the whole company were sick, including myself, but I did not so much as loose one meal by it. I soon had an apetite, which was also  the case with many others; few however were at dinner this day. Upon the whole it was a day of miserable sickening, storm, gales and long billows many of which were full 25 feet in perpendicular height.clouds, rain, howling winds and high sea raged all day Tues 6th Beautiful clear morning, after a terrible night of high winds and high billows. To day the ocean moved in immense swells like small hills, with yawning vallies between, but the morning was clear, and the air mild and further fire unescessary. Our stove being upset this morning we did not rectify it, nor feel the need of it. The sick ones are improving and getting lively; the vessel has bounded on beautifully all day, and we crossed the Gulf Stream this morning, winds from the west which drove us out to sea, possibly 350 miles from land, and this evening a little south of the lattitude of Charleston of South Carolina. Saw one sail to the west this morning. Light clouds in the afternoon, and pleasant moonlight evening, with the sea and winds pretty high. Company merry on deck, & Saw one porpose, 5 or 6 nautilus, and gulf weed this morning all interesting to one looking for a subject. It should have been mentioned that Mr. Hewes, one of our company, lost his belt overboard yesterday containing two hundred and twenty five dollars in gold.Wednesday 7th A cloudy morning, high winds and mountain billows; air cool and winds mostly from the west. We bounded on bravely all this day o'er the foaming sea, realing too and fro, with our deck at times almost at an angle of 45, both side ways and lengthwise. The dishes on the dinner table partook likewise of the general commotion. This whole day was another of swift winds, amounting almost to a gale, which stirred up the billious temperaments of our company as usual, and there were many sick ones about deck again as usual. At 12, at noon, we passed a sail in the distance and at 1.0.clock P.M. another to which we hoisted a red flag with red star upon a square white ground, which they answered with the American flag; the winds and the ocean being  to high to speak them. They were bound to the States. We passed them in about Latitude 32 and about 400 miles out to sea from South Carolina. At night the moon rose amid flying clouds, but the air was so cool, the wind so high, and our deck so much wet by the spray from theangry mountaneous ocean, that few remained on deck long; the berths being prefferable. It is not an uncommon thing to hear one or two fall out of their berths, upon the floor, and to observe a general scrambling of boots, hats, trunks, &c for a downhill race to the opposite sides of the cabin whilst cradling upon the high blue  ribs of the ocean. Then occasionally springing a breeze. Thursd 8th Light clouds, air mild, and a pleasant breeze from the North East, with light ocean waves. Held a meeting on financial arrangements on the Quarterdeck at 10.A.M. Saw a ship ahead this morning bound southward in Latitude 29° 40,\" about 400 miles out to sea. Fine sunny day with bland breezes and very light ocean swells. Nearly all of our company are amusing themselves about decks variously. Catching sea weeds, and fifty other little time killing amusements. At 4 O.clock P.M. we held a meeting on the Quarterdeck during which time we elected Mr. Grant, our Captain, for the trip over Mexico to Mazatlan. Mr. McCrellish, 1st Lieutenant, Mr. Hughes, 2nd do Mr. W. H. Ogden the Quarter Master, and Mr. Thompson, the Commissary. It being understood that we go through during our voyage, a regular Military drilling in order to fit us for cases of insurgency in our Mexican Campaign. A pleasant moonlight evening, air mild, with a brisk breeze, and sailing about 10 Knots the hour. Friday 9th A beautiful morning of pleasant breezes; up early and saw the sun rise clear upon the rolling ocean. We sailed beautifully all day with a fine breeze. Things passed off pleasantly and merrily all day, with a mild and elegant moonlight evening; set up until 11.O.clock, hearing and telling wonderful things, which were magic charms, when told by moonlight on so mild and exquisite evening as this, added the gentle undulations of the sea, the fountains of spray, and the bland Zephyrs of the South. Saw a number of white flying fish during this afternoon, which were beautiful and attractive. Sat 10th A clear, warm, and calm morning, sun even getting hot Near, but not in sight of the West Indies. No wind and almost quiet; Ocean almost quiet; This day proved to be a regular calm, and the sun very warm. Coats and vests off, and hardly a breeze. We do not appear to have moved 15 miles all day. A breeze sprung up in the evening and got us under headway at about 5 knots, with a pleasant late moonlight night. A flying fish came on board this evening and was captured. All are well so far on the vessel. Sund 11th Morning warm, clear, and a brisk wind driving us at the rate of 10 knots towards the island with the \"hole in the wall\", but not in sight yet (11 A.M.) Came in sight of the Bahamia island at 1/2 past 11. A.M. but there being a high head wind, we lost all this afternoon and night in tacking too and from the land, with a high sea. Held a meeting  for worship this afternoon at 1/2 past 3.O.clock. Rev'd Mr. Woods delivered a powerful and highly eloquent appeal to our company, with a good effect. A request was sent to our Chaplain (elect) by several individuals, to their discredit, not to hold services on board; but it being overruled by a large majority, services were held as usual. Monday 12th Mild with high head winds, only about 10 miles gained by tacking the whole day. We were insight of the islands several times during the day. At night a black and angry storm rolled over us with rain and fierce winds raising huge billows, howling and tossing us fearfully about on the ocean all night. Silent fear reign'd in our company, but some hardened cases went so far as to make sport in the midst of this exciting scene. Tuesday 13th Passed the \"hole in the wall,\" with light house early this morning. The sun rose beautifully in a fleecy cloud of golden hue, and a brisk wind drove us rapidly towards the Bahamia Bar, the day is clear, mild, and our Brig passed 5 other vessels this morning all bound in the same direction. Arrived at the Bahamia Bar, at 12 Meridian, and crossed it during the afternoon and evening; The water on the Bar is from 15 to 40 feet generally, and sufficiently clear in most places to see bottom at 15 feet. The bottom appears to be composed of white sand, with here and there patches of sponge. The color of the water on the Bar for about 60  miles is a beautiful light Skye Blue, whilst that of the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico is of a darkand blue color. we passed Berry islands this morning and saw there, a number of small sailing craft, and some about a wrecked vessel. A colored gentleman has a very fine farm, and several wives upon one of these singular looking islands. A good breeze drove us on rapidly ahead of all other vessels. The day has been warm clear, and the sun set among gilded clouds showing us a scene exciting universal admiration. Such a glowing sun set scene, few of us have ever before witnessed even in midsummer. There is something exquisite, glowing, brilliant and more diversified with brilliant and unapproachable colors accompanying a sun set scene in this southern chime, that seldom occurs to those farther north, and infinitely above the Artists pencil. [*Wednesday 14th *] Temperature mild, high and favorable wind driving us rapidly to the South west over the gulf of Mexico. No land in sight this morning. Saw several hundred flying fish this afternoon; the vessel appeared to scare them out of the water. We travelled very rapidly all this day and night.[*Thursd 15th*] Morning clear and mild, with a strong breeze driving us rapidly ahead, no land in sight. The gulf is here of a bluish brown appearance and occasionally when the sun is in a certain position of a greenish cast. Our vessel is now dashing off spray and waves of white foam as though she were ploughing by steam. One of our company Mr Chevallier, fell  down our cabin stairs this morning, but was not seriously injured, though stunned by the (long) fall. [*Frid 16th*] Morning clear, warm, and a regular calm. We were lying still at sun rise, but a breeze sprung up during the morning which increased to a strong wind during the afternoon, and drove us forward quite rapidly. This day was warm and clear. Saw many flying fish as usual with some Nautilus, & the Gulf waters appear now nearly black. The spray is flying skye high o'er deck, and we are dashing onward within about 550 miles of Tampico. Cool, high head wind, rough sea and day generally  cloudy, a day of but little interest. Cool, wind from the North, a strong gale with some rain, sea very high and disagreeable. Saw large schools of Porpoises, at several different times playing about the bow of the vessel, flying fish abundant, with occasionally some curious sea birds. This whole day & night has been exceedingly boisterous and unpleasant. Mon.d 19th  Morning clear, air mild, fair wind and travelling pretty fair. The sick ones of yesterday are getting lively again. no land yet in sight. pleasant evening and travelling rapidly ahead. Tues.d 20th  Morning clear, mild, with fair wind and rapid travelling within 200 miles of Tampico. Wed.nd 21st  Warm and clear. Gulf in a calm. discovered  land at 1/2 past 12 P.M. a fair breeze in the afternoon water of the Gulf getting quite green. The coast of Mexico ranges in barren and here and there partly cultivated hills. very Singular scenery. The pilots came out to us at 4 P.M. and took us into Tampico by dark, being up a small and crooked river about 6 1/2 miles. Vegetation &c was all green and the Spring verdure was here in all its richness fully displayed. The breakers running upon the shore were quite interesting and our entranceto Tampico over the bar was quite favorable. The  county about Tampico is in flats and broken hope  and there into low rolling hills of a peculiar  appearance, covered here and there with dense Chaparell. An officer boarded our vessel and examined  our passports, and we anchored off Tampico in the  river Rio Paneuco. Many porposes were playing  in the gulf as we entered the river. it was a beautiful sun set scene, and the weather quite warm.  we were not permitted to go on shore this evening. We have now arrived in Mexico, 20 1/2 days from  the wharf in Philadelphia. Clear. & Warm like August. landed this morning  at 10.A.M. in Tampico. went to the city Plaza and  examined strange costoms, dress, appearances of things &c. wandered with friends about town and suburbs all  day except when our baggage passed the Custom  House, when we had all taken to private rooms  rented for our company. Our impressions of Tampico  and the Mexicans in general, was at first quite unfavorable,  but in a few days becoming more familiarized with their  very singular manners and appearances, we felt more at home Tampico. State of Tamaulipas. Mexico. 23rd For one Real or 12 1/2 cts in company with a friend I crossed the  Rio or river Paneuco, to the shore of the State of Vera Cruz, from which place I sketched Tampico, as per plate No. 1. To a citizen of the States unaccustomed to foreign life, it at once presents an oriental appearance. There are two plaza's or public squares in the city the principal one facing the  river and the other back, upon which two of the Military posts and a small plain cathedral are located. The streets run generally at right angles, and three fourths of the  houses are one story in height, without chimnies, window glass, boards, or brick; being usually constructed either of bamboo, mud, or stone, which are generally plastered upon the exterior surface, and occasionally painted. The roof of each principal dwelling generally partaking of the usual Mexican trait, though more Americanized than  most other Mexican cities. The suburbs are almost entirely composed of cabins of Bamboo, thatched with the leaves of  the palmetto. The city is located upon a slightly undulating ground and almost entirely surrounded by water. The many singular plants with the beautiful flowers and foliage of spring combined with the lively colors of the dwellings, gave to Tampico, a singular and highly interesting appearance. The mainplaza, is paved with limestone (vide sketch No 2.) in the centre of which there is a large circular pediment of limestone rising in 6 steps, upon the summet of which there was once a monument of Santa Anna; which has been destroyed in their Revolutionary events. The building marked No 1. belongs to the British government; it is a costly and handsome establishment, and is  the head quarters for the immense quantities of silver, brought from the mines of San Louis Polosi. The markets are held every morning upon a part of this plaza. It is inferior to those in the States, though more abundantly stocked with the tropical fruits, at much less prices. Beef, fowls, fish, eggs, cheese, beans, peas, yams, tomatoes, &c with Lemons, Oranges, Bannanna's, plantains, sugar cane, coco nuts, with many vegitables supply this market at cheap rates. Almost every article kept by the Grocers, Dry good Merchants, hardware houses and other merchantile establishments of the States may be found here, but some of the are extravigantly dear. The custom house stands upon the main plaza facing a wooden pier upon the river. Coffee, sugar, rice, tea, tobacco and some other articles are virtually prohibited by their duties. Our party had about $20 worth of the essence of tea, the duties of which was over $30. No. 2 is the dwelling of Mr. Chase the American Counsil.The costom house officers are in general exceedingly punctilious and exact, but a small gold piece, has occasionally induced some of them as in other parts of the Republic, to put on  green spectacles. Our company of 40. were all presented to a tall thin and dignified praefect or chief Alcalde, who signed each pasport, for which he charged each $1. We occupied 3 large rooms in a retired part of the city,  near one of the principal barracks, and a part of the  time cooked our own provisions. We saw several military parades, as large forces were temporarily stationed here,  to prevent a rise on the part of the citizens of this city and State for independence, and annexation to Texas, or  in plain words Annexation to the United States. There was a patroll of small parties of Soldiers with  drum, fife, beaugles, &c. at almost every hour of the day. The complexion of the Mexicans is generally copper, bronze, and sometimes almost black. Their hair black and straight and their features partaking much of the Indian. I think  there is a marked difference between the features and the  color of the Spaniard and the Aztec Indian of Mexico, but they are called Mexicans. The real Aztec occupies generally the lower grades of life, but they appear tobe by far the most honest, sociable, polite, and hospitable. Though, as in other countries there are very conspicuous exceptions. The Sabbath is but little observed here, church open with most of the stores &c in the morning, and all closed in the  afternoon, for dances called fandango's, cockfights and other amusements, etc. You can get a good cup of coffee on the  plaza, or at the \"Caffe de Reverdy\" for a maydue or 6 1/4 cts. toast bread 6 1/4 cts. a cup of excellent chocolate one Real. 12 1/2 cts. eggs 12 1/2 cts per doz. about 2 1/2 lbs of coarse sugar for a  Quartee or 3 cent piece of silver. Flour is high, and bread dear. Tortelias are very common, when well made they are excellent, they are simply finely pulverized corn baked in large thin wafers, until they snap like thin sea biscuit. The Mexicans do not generally live as well nor in the  same manner as those of the States with some exceptions. I have however, tasted pastries here surpassing any thing of the  kind in the States. Good wine from 37 1/2 to 75. cts per bottle. Freoles, or black beans, plenty, cheap, and excellent. In  dress they are peculiar, with many varieties of fashion, and possibly as different from the Americans (in general) as may be found throughout the whole world. A tapering and broad rim hat called a Sombrero; often a tight  [*But meals are usually charged from 25 to 50. cts. and their appendages in proportion.*]and curiously figured buckskin jacket, over clean linen,  a pair of figured buckskin pants opening and buttoning up from top to heel, under the right and left arm, being small above and as broad as a Sailor below; they are generally unbuttoned as high as the knee or the pocket, exhibiting a pair of fine white linen pants beneath, which are also quite airy. The Mexicans are very clean in their dress, in this respect they far surpass the United States. Even our servants or mule drivers, were dressed in their  clean white linens; a thing most remarkable for this country considering their state of civilization. The Cargador or porter will carry a box or package, and yet appear not to soil his fine linen. The high tariffs of Mexico, prevent  the coarser articles from being imported, consequently the  Mexican markets abound with the finest foreign goods. The cloth, or linen is confiscated if it does not count so many threads to the inch when passing the custom house. Lands held in this country from old titles is good, but that from the government is not safe. Mr. Chase, our American  consul, says that during his stay of 15 years at Tampico, he has known the Mexican government to change 16 times consequently their laws, &c. are but temporary powers of vacilationIt is necessary to have a pasport to enter this country which will cost $2 in the States, to countersigned by the Alcalde of each large town you pass through within 48 hours after your arrival, costing at each place 25.cts. with also a pasport to leave the country; A passport to carry arms, and a passport to carry any amount of money beyond your expenses, at 25 per cent discount. Owing to the  reports respecting the country we had to pass over to San Louis Potosi, 5 of our number withdrew and proceeded by themselves. Mr Grant, then withdrew with a large portion of our company, leaving us but 19, which embodied a separate  mining company, having with them a large amount of mining tools, provisions, medicines, etc. amounting to considerable baggage which the other division thought would detain them some weeks longer in getting through to Mazatlan; consequently that party of 16 organized and proceeded some 5 days in advance of us, and procuring their horses at Mr. Laflers Rancho, or farm, they proceeded with dispatch to San Louis Potosi etc. Our party after selling off some unnecessary articles (as every pound to Mazatlan cost us 40 cts.) proceeded on the journey, having obtained our horses of Mr Lafler; 16 miles up the river of Paneuco. The other party of course expectedto be in San Louis Potosi, at least for 8 days ahead of our tardy mules and mustangs. They arrived in San Louis Potosi on the evening of the 21st of March, and our party at sun rise next morning to their surprise, as this journal from Tampico, will show. During our stay in Tampico, many of our party formed acquaintances in this city friendly to the Americans, a disposition evinced throughout the state of Tamaulipas. The weather here is quite as hot as august in the States,  but a fine sea breeze comes from the Gulf of Mexico, every afternoon; that makes our perambulations about town more pleasant. The Senioretta's or Ladies wear no bonnets, but invariably shawls upon their heads, I have seen some that were very beautiful; the early evening is their favorite time of appearance. This is decidedly a great country for moschitoes, ticks, and all kinds of loathesome vermin as we will herein after prove. The States bear not the slightest resemblance in species, quantities, and qualities to them, as they are positively the most numerous and most troublesome inhabitants of Mexico. To pick off 3 or 500 ticks from your pants and coat, as the cost of a venture in some places among the small weeds and bushes, might seem unreasonable, but such is very possible to occurSund 25th  The Priest, has extended an invitation to our company to  attend church. I visited and found but few present. The church is handsomely decorated inside but has a very  antiquated appearance without.  26th No rain and weather excessively warm, and moschetoes  innumerable, and insupportable. I repaired to the bluff  on the river, and from the highest part of it sketched  scene No 3, which comprehends an extensive and interesting  range of country. The first river to the right passing north  is the Rio Tamosee. West of it is the rio Paneuco,  a beautiful little stream meandering off towards San  Louis Potosi, and navigable 150 miles for light draught  boats, through no steamers have yet ascended it for. at fig. 1  is Laflers' Rancho 16 miles up the river; west of it for about  20 miles there is a level prairie. The Mountains fig. 2.  are interesting, as they abound with numerous ancient  walls, curiosities, and remains very similar to those discovered  in Yucatan, by Stephens. An ancient city is  supposed to have covered a number of square miles  on the summet of this mountain; which has been described by Norman of New Orleans. Beyond this west by south  two peaks of immense and distant mountains may be seen  occasionally by a clear sun set.South (fig 3) There is a long and beautiful Lagoona or Lake being about 2 miles wide, beyond it in the direction of Vera Cruz, there are high mountains and fertile plains. In the foreground there is a long tract of prarie, covered with the wild prarie grass, some chaparell bushes, with occasional  patches of low timber, and skirted on the margin of both waters with brushy trees, and one Rancho or (small) farm. [*Mond March 5th*] Weather warm, and yet no rain, but a pleasant  breeze each afternoon. Having all baggage in readiness and our bargains completed for horses and mules, we  embarked with everything belonging to our party in large canoes, in which we made the best of our way up to Laflers' Rancho 16 miles up the Rio Paneuco, to his principal farm or Haciendo, which I sketch'd as in No 4. Showing the Paneuco river, the neighboring mountain which contains its ancient remains of a past city on it and the curious forest in its foreground. This is the  best house on this river. This gentleman is an extensive landholder, his personal property extends  over more than 50 square miles, which he says he purchased some 12 or 14 years ago for $800. He came here originally from the State of Ohio. He has an immense tract, stock, grain, servants &c.and raises Sugar Cane, Coffee, bannanas, Corn, and  many other things, and is the only person I see about  this section of the country making brick. During our  short stay at this pleasant rancho, Mr Thompson, one of  our party obtained a guide over the river, and proceeded out to the ancient city upon the mountain; he reports the way to be difficult and exceedingly unpleasant, but he considered himself amply repaid in beholding some of the  scattered remains of old stone walls, parts of dwellings, implements &c. I was informed in Tampico, that a large  block of stone, appearing to have been part of a monument, was raised there, with an inscription upon the under surface, below it there was another similar block, which has not yet been removed. There are many very interesting matters there for the Antiquarian: Mr  Thompson having shot a deer, returned at Sun set with it, which  was very acceptable to our company. Our party were very much annoyed by clouds of voracious moschetoes, and other exceedingly repugnant insects swarming upon all the undergrowth and weeds of this region of country. At this Haciendo, our dinners were of the best the  country afforded, including a great variety of new dishes.Tuesd 6th Day clear and very warm; our baggage was repacked and carefully weighed; and likewise assorted for mule loads. Horses, mules, and pack saddles was the business of the day Wed 7th Day clear and hot. This morning opened with the buz of preparation for marching to Mazatlan; but for many unprepared considerations, it was postponed one day. Thursd 8th Day clear and hot. Having hired our mules, mustangs and four servants from Mr Lafler, and our guide Don Francisco, being in command as director of our order of march, as interpreter, Sub Commissary &c. and our other officers being elected -- and having carefully loaded all our arms -- we commenced our line of march, -- at 10 A.M. upon an extensive levil and variegated prairie. Westward ho! all in lively spirits; the first large city to which we  looked forward with interest, was San Louis Potosi,  a distance from Tampico of about 350 miles, though variously estimated from 3 to 400 miles according to route. The appearance of our company completely equipped with with guns, rifles, revolvers, knives, swords, &c. was anything but pleasant for a guerrilla to look at, some of which we anticipated meeting. half the day we marched upon a prairie plain, a part of whichhad no timber and scarcely any vegetation. We passed a  pleasant little lake upon which there was an immense quantity of wild game, that was easily approached. in the afternoon we got among some woodland hills, with  a small allowance of very bad water. Our road was only  a very indifferent mule path, and not passible for a  vehicle of any kind, and continues thus quite to S.L. Potosi. On the way we saw immense droves of cattle and horses, roving at large upon the prairies. In the afternoon we  passed a caravan from San Louis Potosi. The road being very dusty, the sun excessively hot, water scarce and bad,  and but little available shade; we were of course quite glad to close this days journey, in camp at a small bamboo hut, on the bank of the Rio Paneuco. - and an  interesting group of dusty travellers we were too, with  a regular saw mill appetite. Freoles, or black beans, with  coffee and corn tortelias, were served round for supper, and notwithstanding they were previously out of credit; they passed very current on this occasion. Our beds and blankets were then spread at random upon the  ground in the open air; and a guard of two set, for every two hours of the night, on the first of which I served two  hourswith my comrade Mr Bods, being from 8 to 10. An early Moon rose upon the meandering and placid waters of the beautiful Rio Paneuco, and a gentle breeze played  fitfully in the overarching foliage around over camp. This was a fit time to remind one of those pleasant evenings at home, of scenes in our native land. Friday 9th Day clear & hot. Got on march before daylight and marched 9 leagues, (27 miles) through a hot sun, dusty paths, winding hither and thither over small hills and bushy plains of no peculiar interest, with no dinner  and a short allowance of very bad limestone water. This evening we anchored again a bamboo cabin, on the banks of the Rio Paneuco, very similar to the last, and found a very short allowance of provisions at  this place. A part of our party went into the river to bathe and found the water quite warm. They were cautioned  however about Alligator gars &c, which are  sometimes dangerous. We camped again in the open air. Sat 10th Day clear & hot. Commenced our march before daylight; being 7 leagues (21 miles) for the day. Travelled most of this day over plains, covered with forest of  palm trees, with dense undergrowth of palmettos.from which the palm fans are made, this change of  scenery was new and very interesting to us. It reminded  me much of the descriptions of palm forrest in Africa and  India, frequently for miles we saw no other trees than  several varieties of the palm, sometimes scattering, and  at others compact reminding one too of the Jersey pines, when seen at a distance. These palms afford but little shade, and grow here usually to the height of from 40 to 50 feet, without branches or leaves, save only upon their very summets. An American unaccustomed to such  very singular scenes cannot comprehend fully from description the majesty they impose at first sight upon the mind of the lover of the wild in Nature. View us winding our way in single file, with baggage mules in advance, with coats off, and red flannen, as  conspicuous; with arms glistening in the mid days sun, the arrearo's or mule drivers singing out with their incessant \"mulah\", the guide ahead  smoking his cigaretto, or little paper cigar, and the  rest of the travellers following like a flock of spring birds in complete tune, and merry felicity, among dust, sunshine, and the shadeless forrests of palm. [*20*] In places however the palms, and palmettos arched over our road.and gave us a partial shade for a short period, then we would come up on an open plain, followed by a regular forrest of various trees, massive, dense, and overgrown with immense vines, and peculiar trees for occasional undergrowth; next a few small hills, then a brushy plane, followed again and again with the forrests of palm. Parrots and many other birds of gay plumage were very abundant and exceedingly noisy. Here and there the grass and brush have been fired and burned off for many miles. We encamped again at a bamboo cabin on the Rio Paneuco, very similar to the last, here again most of our party bathed in the river. I saw some diminutive watermellons at this Rancho, and helped to taste one. Our fare at this place was reasonable, but charges superior. The water is still very indifferent and strong of limestone. 11th Day clear and hot. Started early for a Rancho on the  Tamouin & Paneuco. 9 leagues (27 miles) The scenery of this day was much diversified and interesting with palms, plains, hills, gullies, brushes, and forrests. Among which I saw very many curious Banyan trees, or the wild figg tree. So curious were they, that if time had permitted I should have, certainlysketched a number of them. I think it is the same species of the Banyan tree of India. I saw several  cases of palm trees completely imbedded in the very trunks of immense Banyan trees, and being quite ornamental  to it. This tree returns from its from its branches direct  in a perpendicular line very frequently to the ground  in long cords like ropes, which take root and spring up again, in many shapes and sizes, and in many  cases more than a hundred times from one large tree. On this days march we saw several curious Mounds. We arrived at the Tamowin about 3.P.M, and after sending all baggage over with ourselves in [a] canoes,  we finished our crossing by swimming the horses & mules,  on the opposite bank we encamped at a large and  good looking Rancho, being at the junction of the  rivers Paneuco and Tamowin. Here we purchased a calf of good size for $.3.00, and prepared him accordingly, for further use upon the way. Water still unpalatable. This evening a part of our company were in to swim again. From circumstances we inferred trouble with guerrillas, but the guards were vigilant, and we left at 1.O.clock next  morning winding over way through a forest by moonlight.Mond. 12th Day clear & hot. Proceeded by early moonlight (1.O. clock) on our way for Villa de Viase. At sunrise we arrived at the first- Mountain on our way called the \"Siera Madre\" or Mother Mountain. Before entering the pass, the traveller will find a valuable warm Sulpher Spring, of great medicinal properties not far from the path. As you approach the pass, the scene is peculiar. You walk and lead your Mustangs over a rocky path, of such barbarous rudeness that you may deem it a venture for a Mountain goat, and yet your horse must be taxed with all his personal wits to puzzle his way out over loose rocks that edge over the precipice of an almost bottomless uncertainty. The mules, -they are as sharp as Chatham Yankees, for they will carry a load, where a common man would want room to tout over his own shadow. They are perfect baggage wild cats, and climb rocks with heavy loads as if they had claws, or were cammels in the desert of Arabia. We passed over one high and exceedingly dangerous precipice,  and other unpleasant places, and finally passed through a very narry and precipitous valley that meandered like the bed of a little river diagonally across the mountain, with almost the slightgrade of a rail road, and generally not much over 300 feet in width, but steep and of great height with timber on each side edging up the mountains, the meanderings of this cavern-valley  with its hight cliffs, and little coves and passes, gave to the whole scene a peculiar wildness and Sublimity. We scared up five young deer among the rocks; It was in this mountain pass that from report, we first  anticipated some Mexican Indians, or Guerillas; in this pass they could sweep and be safe; and although our guns were several times fired, none made their appearance to us. After crossing the mountain pass, we came upon an undulating country still uninhabited, though in many places of a very rich soil, covered sometimes with good timber and now and then prarie grass, with occasional barrens of wild and cavernous limestone rocks. Entrances to caves are to be seen, and in one place a romantic spot, an immense well of an oval form descends perpendicularly through limestone rocks to a great debth. Some ancient trees bend gracefully over and around its mouth. To day also, I found the remains of an ancient town and the appearance of an ancient fort on our way to the village de Viase. Revd Mr Woods and myself passed on in the advance of the trainMarch, 1849.  a mile or two, with the view of arriving at the village in  advance of the train. on the way just as we had pas a  slight bend of the road, we saw five uncouth looking Mexicans sitting on the bank of a dry creek; the wispered suspiciously until we came beside them, when they all arose at once with sticks, and gathered around us, supposing something rong on foot, I drew my gun from its sheath, and exhibited also my revolver and knife. Mr Woods prepared himself also by exarming his gun &c. These fellows followed us a short distance evidently meditating our arms, when they fell  off from us on being told that many Americans were just behind. We arrived in the village early in the afternoon, and found Mr Grants division just on the point of leaving for S.L. Potosi. This being the place where all our horses had to be shod for the mountains to come. We encamped on the village plaza, pitched our tents, prepared our own food, &c. Tuesd 13th Day hot and clear, examined the appearance of the village with friends, and obtained a good bowl of coffee two eggs and bread on the plaza for 1 Real, 12 1/2 cts. We have discovered that  Milk, Eggs, freeoles, tortelias, Oranges, and Coffee may be  readily obtained at almost every place; all of which  are very cheap, except coffee. On the Plaza of thisvillage there stands the remains of an Ancient Catholic Church. The Cupola is yet in a tollerable State of preservation and 3 bells yet hang in it of a very Anti- quated appearance. Upon its summet shrubs, cactus, grass may be seen as luxuriant as upon Terra firma. Vide sketch No 5. To the right of it is a long bamboo  building thatched with palmetoes; in it the Catholic citizens hold their Service. From appearances within we judge this chappel to contain more real wealth than many of those magnificent edifices of the States. This day was occupied in Shoeing our horses. Mr. Lafler of Tampico came in the village some 90 miles from his Rancho in order to have them properly attended too, the Shoes having been brought here from Tampico. The price of Shoeing here is from 3 to 5 dollars per horse, in the States about one dollar. Here they most generally throw the animal upon the  ground and tie him there with ropes. The Smith shops and other mechanical departments appear more like burlesques than the representation of a half civilized people. This morning I ascended the cupola of the plaza ruins and then beheld a beautiful view of the Siera Madre Mountains 12 miles westward as in Sketch No. 6.The foreground from the mountain was nearly a levil plane, intersperced here and there with apparent clearings, which in several cases proved to be small open and natural praries, probably never cleared by the hand of man, as they were not much used. A small rapid and romantic river passes under a deep bluff beside the village, where our party were again into bathe, as the day was excessively hot and the water agreeable. The peaks of the Siera Alta, appeared like a cloud in the distance. In offering a pass to the  traveller these mountains are very high and formidable. Just as I had completed this sketch the priest of the parish a very pleasant man ascended the tower and expressed much pleasure at finding me sketching, and thereupon requested me to descend and dine with him, to which I complied with much pleasure, in descending the tower in a shady recess, he placed my arms around  himself he also embraced me, with much feeling, and said that he liked the Americans. His dinner was served  up in the best Mexican style, with wine and numerous new dishes, served in about 8 or10 changes of plates. I left much gratified with his hospitality. Our horses being in readiness, at 4.P.M. we commenced our marchtoward the foot of the Siera Madre Mountains. In leaving and crossing the river by the ford, it was very gratifying to see about 90 or 100 Mexicans upon the high bluffs and along the road to see us out and bid us a friendly adieu, and Adios, adios, adios, was echoed here, there and yonder, which signifies - \"to God\"- we commend you. We travelled some 10 miles this evening and camped in a wild spot about 2 miles from the foot of the mountain. My sketchbook, a satchell, and a coat belonging to Mr Sayre, were lost after dark before camping, but 3 of us returned by moonlight before sun rise and found them. Our camp fire looked really interesting this evening with the sentinals parading around the sleepers who where rolled  up in blankets; who constantly watched among the timbers and bushes for enemy and wholves, the latter of which made themselves known before daylight. [*Wedn 14th.*] Day hot & clear. Arose before before daylight and proceeded to the Siera Madre Mountain. As we ascended, I observed numerous scattering mounds, parts of old walls &c, the timber became large and dense. I believe that there is a spring (the only one from Tampico to S Louis Potosi) not far from the road to the right as you ascend the mountain.our path over the mountain was in ascent by windings about 3 miles, and nearly the same in descending over the opposite side and other hills. The whole scenery was wild beyond description. Could this road or path be exhibited in a civilized country, it would be considered dangerous even for a mountain goat; how then shall I describe it, when a painter would consider it beyond a just representation if skillfully drawn. We lead our horses up the  steep precipitous masses, jumping and scrambling from  rock to rock sometimes two feet perpendicularly. The most ragged and cragged ledges, holes, chasms, and peaks that  the mind could picture for feats in horsemanship. Reader! you have doubtless seen nominally bad roads in the States, but they convey only a faint idea of the  hardships you must encounter in passing the formidable crags upon these mountains of distracted rudeness. Having surmounted the first Series, we descended upon  similar sharp and pointed edges into a wild and  romantic cove, leading off over and around other more  passable hills, in full view of numerous mountains ranging at random in every direction, until we reached the Ranch la Pier, by a small lakeupon a beautiful plane, and here we encamped for the night, having arrived early in the afternoon. The proprietor of the Rancho, is an Alcalde of wealth, and a man of affable manners. Before sun set we ascended a neighboring hill and sketched scene No. 7. including a large assemblage of distant mountains. The setting sun cast back their shadows upon the planes, as I descended, and lent a passing beauty to them ever to be remembered. From advice given us by the Alcalde, it was thought advisable to change our rout over the mountains to San Louis Potosi, by a nearer and more safe direction. The Mexican forces, and Indians or Guerrillas, being  upon the regular route, which would cause us trouble. The first division having gone that way unadvised, they met with difficulties, detention, and considerable danger. Thurs 15th Day clear & hot. Entered upon the nearer route, and passed palm forrests, old fortifications, and a fine little river, where  we filled our canteens with refreshing and cool water, the best from Tampico, and accomplished a long march and 6 or 7 formidable mountains of worse paths than any previously travelled. To describe our labours on these volcanic rocks of gothic masonry, would be romantic indeed.but suffice it to be said that this days march was  the most wild rugged and exhausting of any to San Louis Potosi. On this route I had the pleasure of discovering a  magnificent cavernous Amphitheatre of several thousand feet in diameter, and about 300 feet in perpendicular  debth, covered below with dense timber, and overhung with high arching cliffs of great magnificence. Our mountain scenery today was exceedingly grand though we enjoyed it but little owing to the difficult passes to be encountered. Many of the mountains had no timber, nor even vegetation upon them; being vast masses of rude brown rocks particularly upon their summets. Had time permitted, I should have sketched some of these alpine scenes of barrenness for the information and curiosity of my friends and readers. They are totally unlike anything I ever before saw  in point of complete barrenness and appeared really savage. At sunset we descended into a romantic valley and wound around several Sugarloaf hills, by dark into the beautiful village of San Nicholas, where we encamped upon a pleasant plaza of grass in the midst of the village and at the foot of a large and imposing mountain.but suffice it to be said that this days march was the most wild rugged and exhausting of any to San Louis Potosi.

Whilst watering our horses at a pond in this valley, two suspicious Mexicans appeared, one over the pond, and the other near us apparently examining our arms, &c. and in a short time one of them made bold to tell two of our party that  he was one of a party defeated by the Mexican Government, and that they were many, who were now in persuit of  plunder, both of them were handsomely dressed, and rode upon first class animals. We turned to the left from this interesting valley, through a pass in the hills similar to  No 9. when we came in view of the beautiful and-- romantic village of Tortugas, or village of turtles, where we arrived at 4 P.M. and located ourselves in a  small brush school house, upon a small riding ground well adapted to defence, as an attack of the Guerrillas was looked for, as quite certain during the night. Many of the inhabitants collected around us with curiosity and pleasure, as they hoped we would be of service to them in case of an attack of the Guerrillas or robbers. We were all in anticipation of a fight, when we saw a small fire upon the summit of a neighboring mountain, supposed to be a signal light. Guns, pistols &c were allwith here and there patches of stunted vegetation, growing among the wild mountain rocks. Among these I saw a number of strange and interesting trees, curious plants, magueys, palmettoes, coco's, and a strange fruit resembling the pine apple, being twice as large, and filled with numerous small soft white fruits, much resembling in appearance and taste the common chesnut, which were very abundant on one of the mountains. I also saw a shrub or bean plant bearing flowers, resembling skeins of white & red silk, from 1 to 2 inches in thickness, and from 4 to 6 inches in length. On this days march we passed through many very peculiar mountains, scenes of interest. No 9 (sketch.) was taken on horseback whilst passing into the valley of corn. No 10. is a view of the Valle de Maise, or valley of corn, looking to the north. This valley is about one mile in width, and many in length. The hills upon either side are nothing of nearly void of vegetation, the whole valley is divided into large fields for corn, and well improved with stone fences. The soil is rich and corn flourishes here luxuriantly. Far on the northern horizon a high mountain wasall of which grew from 4 to 15 feet in height, and chiefly among the interstices of the rocks. It appeared to be a  section of country almost useless for any purpose, and it  really appeared strange, how such a barren wilderness of  of thorns could be at all inhabited where water was  also very bad and scarce; in the afternoon we travelled among clouds of dust, with a hot sun and but little breeze. before sunset we encamped under a tree, beside, a desolate mud dwelling upon a deasert plane, much like a scene in the desert of Arabia, appearing quite as barren and  forlorn, as the immagination could well picture as in sketch No 13. A large old fashioned rope and pulley well, was in the  vicinity, at which about 40 Mexican women, were engaged in drawing water, and carrying it away in large earthen jars upon their heads, bearing a striking resemblance to the old Egyptian costoms, in dress, color, and manners. At this place we fared slim and paid well for it. Sund 18th   Day clear and warm. Proceeded on our journey at 6.A.M. very  anxious to get out of this barren and sandy wilderness. and travelled nearly all day over diversified planes of  limestone, palms, maguays, casters, some timber, and for a  mile or two, for the first time a woodland of beautiful cedars.put in the best order, our camp fire put out, and two guards put on duty. The Alcalde paid us a friendly visit, and many of the inhabitants brought us cheap provissions, and the night passed off without trouble. [*Sat. 17th.*] Day clear and warm. The inhabitants came in numbers to bid us a friendly adios. I pencil'd sketches No 11. and 12. just before leaving showing on No 11. our position in camp at the school house, and an opposite view looking South. Oranges flourish here, and are  very cheap, eggs are plentiful, with many useful articles of provissions. Soon after leaving this pleasant village, we ascended several large and barren hills, and in a few hours descended a very romantic pass down upon prarie plains and cultivated fields. our views on this days journey were extensive new diversified and interesting. We came to a  small village of a very romantic appearance, beside a little stream of water, where at first the inhabitants were much terrified at our appearance. We saw but little timber, during the whole day, the planes and  hills, being almost covered with wild cactus, prickley pears, and the short scrubby palms, etc.At intervals for several miles, the ground was as white as the very snow of a northern winter, having a saline taste, in places, in others that of Epsom Salts, and as fine as the very best flour. Caverns were beneath, for we  could often hear the footsteps of our horses echoing beneath, and now and then a chasm or deep pit would  appear. When timber appeared in the usual form of groups or clusters, it usually had a singular appearance, much resembling extensive Apple, and  Peach orchards. The country had conspicuous marks of a volcanic origin upon a limestone foundation. We were almost constantly in sight of distant ranges of lofty and rugged mountains, lending romance to the day. and now and then large planes, covered with prairie grass would extend for before the eye to the mountains skirted here and there with pleasant shady woodlands. We arrived at the Hacienda about 4. P.M. and were  gratified to find it a place much superior to the last,  not only for provisions, but also for shade and comfort. About 9.O.clock this morning we arrived at a place on the valley plane, where a stream of clear and very strong limestone water meandered from a small lake, and in a short distancedisappeared beneath the ground; this water though clear and cold, was so strongly impregnated with the Carbonate of lime, that though we were very thirsty, we could scarcely drink it. During a temporary halt, I sketch'd this lake No. 12 [*14*], and its vicinity southward. Game was plentiful here, and  several of our party delay'd some on account of it. Mr Sherman, one of the same , remained there so long that  in persuit of our caravan he missed the path and  was lost for a day and a half suffering greatly from exposure and other great dangers; after some delay, expense,  and trouble in scouring the country in various directions with a Mexican guide, he was at last found, much fatigued frightened, and sick, having encountered considerable perils. I remained some time behind the company in waiting for  Sherman, as long as I felt it safe from missing the way  myself, expecting him to come up upon this path, [during that time I sketched scene No 14. a high] on our right there was a high mountain [to] [the North] bearing the marks of a large volcano. Some of our party were in to bathe again this evening, but as our journey has elevated us much, the water is now becoming cooler especially each night, which is cold enough for two or three blankets, whilst  the mid day sun is quite hotMond 19th Day warm and clear. Proceeded on our journey at 7.O. clock. sMuch of this days journey was very similar to the last, at times winding among barren hills, small planes of cactus, thorns scattering palms, gullies and rocks, with small groves of peculiar trees of a stunted growth. Before sun set we crossed a beautiful and fertile plane under cultivation with corn, and haulted for a short time at a large well on one of the fields one and a half liles from, and in full view of the beautiful little town of Ceretus de San Juan; at the suburbs of which we encamped within a large yard for the  night. Before day light had left the hills of Ceretus, I passed through several parts of the town, and Sketched the church and plaza as in No 15. Showing the valley and hills eastward, over which we had passed during the after part of the day. The appearance of this little town is quite genteel the houses being mostly constructed of Stone and frequently whitewashed and as often secluded in pleasant Shady yards and groves of the trees and shrubs peculiar to this country.Tuesd 20th  Day warm and clear. Proceeded on our journey at 6.O.clock. Just as we were leaving the yard the horse belonging to Mr Thompson, taking fright at some object ran off through the yard, and brok his rifle into many small pieces, Mr T.--escaping unhurt. About 1 mile from  Ceretus, looking westward, I sketched scene No 16. showing the barren hills, a hacienda to the right, and the little clusters of bushes, dotting the ground like miniature islands. We were among the hills and ravines all day, and passed up one very interesting pass between barren mountains which was several  miles in length. On the way before entering this pass,  and at the commencement of a fine broad road, we  halted for a short time at a large Hacienda, called San  E Pedro No 17. having westward a beautiful mountain view, south the cultivated fields and distant hills, and around the dwelling several beautiful groves, over the principal door was painted in large letters, \"Casa Particular\". It being a public house or hotel of the  Mexican order. Having ascended through peculiar scenes of the passes, to the summet of the mountains, we then passed a long time over a wild rocky and entirely desolatewilderness, almost entirely destitute of the smallest vegetation, except in some particular spots, where small stone & mud huts of misery were now and then to be seen. Before descending we passed a small mud village in a little rocky and desolate ravine; with only a few cactus, thorns, and stunted brush, but no regular timber about it. It looked much like solitude and misery. The road has now become excellent, and for the first time we found it graded and paved as a regular road up the mountain. Wooden crosses are plentiful and conspicuous, they are more numerous now than on the way back to Tampico; Sometimes two or three in sight of each other may be seen and particularly on this days march. We are told that these crosses are erected upon the particular spots, where travelers have been murdered. if so, this is decidedly a great country. As we descended the mountain, winding our way down a dangerous pass, a beautiful plane, with a range of barren mountains 15 miles westward, appeared before us, which I hastily sketched as our party descended to the plane, as in number 18. This plane is about 15 miles in width, and almost entirely covered with a brush peculiar to this country.This plane, of the valley is quite level and of very great length, the camino that crosses it, is at least 100 feet broad, and would be an elegant road for travel if not so abundantly supplied with dust and sand. Our party were so much enveloped in dust, that during a portion of the time some of them were not distinguishable at the distance of a few rods. Clouds of dust arose high in the air, and marked in places the spots where persons were moving on many parts of the plane. Such scenes have however been long familiar to us from the very city of Tampico. At sun set we arrived at the \"Meson De Fern\" a public house called Pestelius located in a desert of sand, a few miles from a village to the north west and off from the road. At this place, we found Capt Grants' division of the Camargo Company, who met us in a sociable manner as old friends, the two divisions having taken different roads to San Louis Potosi.. Mr Chevallias' party of 5 having also arrived the whole Camargo Company were again together. At night, a high wind arose and gave us a complete storm of dust, exceeding anything of the kind that I have ever before witnessed in any country, reminding one of the desert of Arabia.Wednd 21st Day warm and clear. Capt. Grants division, left before sunrise in order to reach San Louis Potosi before night. Our company proceeded on the way an hour after, as we did not design pressing our horses and mules with a very long days march. Nos 19 and 20 are exterior and  interior views of the desert house where we camped. To the right of the house, there is a large well, which is deserving of notice; two or three hoses are fastened by beams to a vertical shaft, which by 8 right angle sticks move a horizontal beam, to which there is a wheel about 12 feet in diameter, with ropes and  about 20 leather buckets, for raising water from the  well to a trough, and from thence into a stone bason  about 60 feet square, and 8 or 10 feet in debth. This water was fair and cool, and very desirable for the country. Such wells are not frequent, and found only occasionally at the large Haciendo's or Ranchoe's of the wealthy. Water on this road from Tampico to  San Louis Potosi, is scarce, and in almost every instance very unpalatable, muddy, and dangerous to the stranger. It is therefore nescessary for travellers to be cautious in drinking the water along this route                                                                      in particular. This days journey was very similar to the last, with hills and dusty roads, with a hot sun, brushy planes, thorns, and large cactus of various forms, &c. Mountains of barren rocks were seen all day, but we travelled chiefly upon the planes. About 4 in the afternoon we arrived at the Rancho de los Soledad, previous to which I sketched scene No. 21 as we descended to the valley in which this rancho is located, This plane is very wide, and a very considerable length, on this plane about 30 miles to the left is located the city of San Louis Potosi, in full view of large Mountains, though not within several miles of any of them. No. 22 is a sketch of the Haciendo or \"Rancho de los  Solidad\", and its neighboring mountain, which I sketched before sun set, this scene is looking S. East. We encamped opposite to this in a large Mud wall with appartments for travellers as in Sketch No. 23. The inhabitants are now becoming less friendly than they were back over the mountains. And are decidedly against the Americans in the popular feeling, and have occasionally expressed those feelings with insults, and a few words of contempt, which some of them have learned from the American deserters, in the English language. We have seen a number of these contempitible shadows of white men and almost as often heard their curses, or indecent language, but we have generally left them unnoticed. At this rancho we saw a large amount of arms and lances, with an American Rifle, pistols, swords &c which led us to suspicion the character of the place strongly; we however kept our Arms and Sentinels in good trim, and were ready at the word, to show them that in defence we were the same original Americans that they might have before read about. Had our numbers been small enough to suit their taste, I have no doubt but that a fight would have resulted judging from all circumstances, questions, &c. Being in the neighborhood of S. L. Potosi, it is now absolutely nescessary to be constantly on your gard for all shapes of thieves, Robbers, Guerillos, &c., etc, etc. who appear to compose a large proportion of the population. [*Thursd 22nd*]  We left the Rancho, this morning at 3. O. clock for San  Louis Potosi, the road was broad, and lined with cactus, from 5 to 15 feet in height. We were all awake for any attack on the way. Having travelled 15 miles by 1/2 past 8.O. clock A.M. we entered the Splendid and singular city of San Louis Potosi, having passed through a beautiful little village before entering Potosi. The city is situated upon a large and beautiful plane, which is under good cultivation, and is for several miles in every direction; divided into regular right angle  \"streets and roads. The fences of the roads, if they may be so called are composed of the high pentangular cactus, growing in single stems of about 5 inches diameter to a  height of about 8, 10, or 15 feet, and frequently so close together that it is generally capable of shutting out the smallest animal. The average width of the streets are about 30 feet. A member of large and handsome species of trees range along them, with which I am not familiar, one of which resembles in bark, limb, and  site, the Locust, with leaf of a small fern. Another, has the shape and height of a poplar, with the denseness of the black thorn hedges of the States; it is a  beautiful tree of a dark green color, and very ornamental. The maguay is another peculiar plant, very abundant here; I have seen fences made of them extending many miles at a time, and very common everywhere  onour way from Tampico. All these interesting plants, trees &c. with a large number that would be  difficult to describe, but which nevertheless are exceedingly beautiful, belong to this country and are so abundant as at times to cover many miles in compact masses, so much so that it would be difficult for a man to pass among them as they all, with but little exception possess luxuriant crops of  thorns. All these species crowd the roads and surround the fields as you pass into San Louis Potosi. I also for the first time saw two peach trees in full blossom in a beautiful garden at the suburbs of the city. And many beautiful flowers of singular beauty were in full bloom likewise and filled the air with the richness of their morning fragrance. Several fine fields of ripe barley added to the view, their mellow orange hues, whilst, the plough (a rude woodden concern) was busy beside. The Orange, Lemons, and fig trees were also handsome when blended with their fruits, beneath other more conspicuous trees, among which was one called the Peru, another the China tree, andyet another larger and decorated with more exquisite brilliance than I have ever before witnessed. all these with their charming colors and luxuriance bent gracefully over our dusty roads as we passed into the great central metropolis of Potosi. The morning sun had already arrisen upon the domes, towers and minarets of Potosi, as our company entered it from the North. There was so much of the grand and the humble combined, that I could not but remark its resemblance to what I had read of St Petersburg and Moscow, as described by travellers in Russia. After wending in single file our tortuous way amid dense crowds of strange brown faces, around the various streets of the city we at last took up our quarters at the St Anthony house, which was commodious and  constructed strictly after the Mexican order, and one of the first hotels in the city, though, not by any means adapted to the ideas of Americans, being very similar to sketches Nos. 19. and 20. The suburbs of the city (which are very extensive) are almost entirely composed of miserable looking one story flat roof'd mud dwellings of a dilapidated appearance which are much inferior to  the [*34*]very lowest order of dwellings found in any part of the  States, and contrast in a very striking manner with the numerous splendid sanctuaries, public buildings, towers, domes, and superfluous grandeur of the interior city. None of our company even dreamed of the surprising splendours, which broke so suddenly upon them, when they entered the thronged plazas amid the thousands of vacant gazers who seem'd to view us as some unearthly intruders, just draft among them from some other plannet. Our ideas were never so much unhinged at when too closely crowded by dense throngs of starving Mexicans, who with wondrous eyes and  open mouths, Knew not in decency where to end their extravagant curiosity. As we entered the  streets were quick ly thronged, the windows and  iron gratings filled with Seniorettas or Ladies, the doors with wise heads and muchatcha's of boys with some upon the very house tops, to the  Americans enter into the precincts of their almost forbidden walls of China. An unfriendly feeling towards the Americans was soon evident from their language  as it was a day of religious ceremonies, and rest from labor, the church and plaza was thronged, by Mexicans dressed in their holliday best. We passed through this pleasant town, without halting and ascended a steep, high and rugged mountain at the immediate suburbs of the town. On looking back towards Amattitan, distant 14  miles to the South east and Tekelah at its base I hastily sketched the view as in No 59. On ascending this mountain I saw an animal of the Lizard Species about 2 feet in  length lying upon a large boulder rock in a ravine. After ascending we passed several miles through a  a deep, [and] very narrow, and crooked ravine among the highland hills; it was perfectly adapted to the purposes of Ladrones or Robbers, and has been recently the theatre of bloody deeds, robberies, &c. Here jet black Quartz began to appear plentiful after passing in single file for Several miles under the arches and bluffs of this wild and narrow ravine, we descended into a small and pretty valley, where there was a small farm, green fields and some water, from  this we ascended large hills, almost composed of  [*35*]the same brittle jet black quartz, before named. So much so, that it was hard upon the feet of our animals, we again descended into a gently sloping valley of about two miles in width, at the far northern end of which we could see the interesting Lake of Madalena, which I sketched on a nearer approach as in No 60. Showing the town of Madalena on the margin of the Lake, beyond which that welcome sheet of water with its interesting mountain scenery appeared, reminding one much of similar scenes in Italy and Switzerland; and rather unlike many other Mexican towns. At this place we stopped in a comfortable mason overnight, halting about 4 P.M. An opportunity offering I went and upon the margin of the lake and sketched view No 61 looking west among the mountains over which the sun was setting. Also No 62 looking south east towards part of the town Madalena is a town of a shady and pleasant appearance. Most of its streets are narrow and crooked, but well shaded in general. The plaza, was of good size and had a fine large antiquated church upon the south eastern side of it. Around which there was a large crowd of worshippers,uncivil manners, and in two of our party being stoned upon the city plaza; all of which we readily discovered and were particularly cautious, in being upon our guard, whilst we were frequently rendering civilities for incivilities. To these however we are happy to state that there were a number of exceptions, among the higher classes, and the better informed, which gave us a better opinion of Potosi, than we otherwise should  have had. We were nearly three days in this interesting city during which time whilst our guide was preparing fresh mustangs &c for our further journey to Mazatlan; and having some opportunities, I availed myself of them in visiting and sketching some of the massive and beautiful churches &c, having first obtained permission from an alcalde's clerk in the Governors' Palace, to visit and sketch as I wish'd. I proceeded in company with an American friend about 1 1/2 miles south from  the city, towards the Mosa Mountain, where from the remains of an old mud fort, I sketched the domes  &c of the city as in No 24. nearly all of which belong to magnificent churches erected many years past by the Spaniards at enormous costs, and decorated  in theinterior with gorgeous and the most exhorbitant displays of wealth and splendour that the human immagination could well conceive of, and far exceeding any thing of the kind to be found in the States. An open plane of more than a mile in extent each way extended between the fort and the city, upon which several hundred Mexican soldiers were exercising with targets, drilling &c. At this time large forces are concentrated here, who appear to be preparing for political struggles for power. To the right of this open plane, there are four parallel rows of the beautiful Alamo trees forming a shady and a very pleasant walk of about one mile from the city proper southward to the front  of the magnificent sanctuary (Santoario) as in fig 25. At each end and along this walk there are handsomely ornamented fountains. No 25 is a view of the Sanctuary and Mosa Mountains from the same position, where fig 24 was taken. A nearer view of the Sanctuary was then taken from the front near a fountain, as in fig 26, including two fountains two neat gardens, and the style of seats surrounding the principal fountain. The workmanship upon this magnificent edifice appears to be a contribution of the various orders ofArchitecture which in execution I believe to be superior to any thing similar which I have seen in the States. Not even excepting Trinity Church in New York, and composed of a hard red sand stone very similar to the one named. This church though over a mile from the city was under military guard, from whom I asked permission to enter but was told that the chief key of the Sanctuary was in the posession of the Captain, who was out drilling his  men upon the plane beforementioned. On returning to the city we passed a number of handsome edifices of  singular and antiquated appearance, but my opportunities limited me in sketching many of them. The streets were thronged in almost every direction, and should one attempt a sketch in their presence, a crowd of noisy gabbling superstitious men, women, and children, would soon compell a retreat, at the risk of being stoned, amid the jeers, and language suiting degraded and grossly ignorant minds. I was told there were over fifty handsome Sanctuaries or churches in this city, which from appearances I doo not doubt. None but the Catholic religion is tolerated here as in other parts of the Republic, and in passing each Sanctuary, even upon the opposite side of the street, the person is required to takeoff his hat, and retain it in his hand, until he has passed the door of the Sanctuary, otherwise he is liable to be stoned at the shortest notice; if nothing worse may happen him. I'm entering the church during service he is required to kneel, and to accompany respectfully in the ceremonies of the church. The interior splendors of these numerous churches, I could not describe in justice within my present compass. Their displays are gorgeous in the highest degree of man's ingenuity; and frequently exhibit much of the Theatrical; in some instances the walls and high gothic roof, being entirely covered with thousands of gothic (relief) devices, are entirely gilt with gold or silver leaf, until the whole interior glitters like a solid golden palace, with richly ornamental chandaliers, lights of various colors, hundreds of Statues of life size, adorned in robes of brilliant colors, gems, in great profusion, magnificent organs, select gallaries for the paintings, relicts, and statues of the saints, in one apartment of the St Domingo Sanctuary I was shown the bones of saints, and such other things as would fill a volume to describe.On returning to the main plaza, I sketched the Palace  of the governor as in fig 27. a crowd of noisy belligerents soon manifested a a jeering aspect, which compelled me  to finish my sketch rather hastily. I then passed off hastily until I had eluded the noisy crowd of  ignorammus's and by permission getting upon the  roof of a house. I sketched therefrom the beautiful  and very extensive Sanctuary of \"San Francisco\" as in  fig 28. showing its domes, cupolas, and spires as it appeared from the North east corner. Its bells  are numerous of many tones, and remarkably fine; the  interior like an immense museum, is crowded, with  wealth, and splendours beyond description. It has  as near as I can judge over, one thousand apartments,   a part of which are very elegant in their styles, guildings,  statues, paintings, stuccoed works, altars, tombs, vaults,  organs, galleries, painted domes, stained glass, chandeliers, massive gilt gothic works &c. &c. It covers a large  square, and is almost a royal city of itself. I after proceeded  to the Church and College of St. Josephs, which I  sketched as in No 29. My visits also extended to the magnificent  Sanctuary of St. Domingo, the front of which wasGuarded by a large mounted Cannon, and in a house, beside it several hundred soldiers. The interior of this great  church was the most gorgeous I ever beheld, its walls  and gothic ceiling was so gilt with gold leaf, as to appear  like one immense golden gothic palace. The Captain  of this division politely accompanied me through the  church, explaining its sacred relicts, &c. Among which  I saw immages of Angels, about 4 feet in height appearing to be cast of Gold, encased in splendid cases over  the grand Altar. A similar image of the Virgin  and Saviour sitting upon a throne of very massive  silver clouds, over which was an immense dome  inlaid with porcelain of rich colors. There was A large and  beautiful Organ upon a highly ornamented gallery, resting  upon Lions, that seemed watching the congregation,  And numerous saints in richest robes, (of nearly full  size) were to be seen in every direction. The interior  forum of the church was that of a cross, having two  magnificent Altars. I asked permission to sketch this  fine church from the little plaza front, but was  told that it could not be granted, without a  special permit. I then proceeded to sketch theyards, with numbered cells, in which from 10 to 30 may sleep on a brick pavement, having their own blankets of course. There is usually a cook shop in one of these cells, called a \"Fonda,\" where coffee, meat &c. are prepared to order, and usually well charged for; although the cooking may be very inferior to any thing in the States. In chocolate, however, the Mexicans excel, and sometimes in coffee, and especially in light sweet cakes. March  25th.  (Sunday)  Our company (of between 40 and 50,)  Left San Louis Potosi this morning at half past five, in double file presenting to the gazing crowds quite a military face, as red flannel was very conspicuous on almost every man, for almost every coat was off, it being clear moderately warm, and very dusty for a time. In the distance the city appeared beautiful and interesting. We soon entered upon open and barren rolling hills, where I found several handsome specimens of agate scattered among gravel. I neither heard of, or saw any of the silver mines of this State, though I believe them to exist in Durango, Zacatecas, and the state of San Louis Potosi, as large silver trains pass down to Tampico from this country, every few weeks. [*38A*]about 10 miles from San Louis, we entered upon some very rocky hills, into deep ravines, several narrow vallies and through narrow passes, with a cross here and there at short intervals, marking the spot where some traveller has been murdered, and his remains, if poor, deposited beneath. Our company was composed of over 40 American two Spanish guides, 8 Arrearos' or mule drivers, (Mexican) and 14 pack mules to carry our baggage allowing 150lbs. to each mule in order to travel with speed and safety. Our guns, pistols, swords, knives, &c. were all ready for immediate use, and were kept in excellent order, and many of our boys made the vallies echo with their jovial songs whilst passing, at the same time keeping an eye for any vagrant Guerrillas among the cliffs and brushes. One of the narrow vallies through which we passed during this day was peculiarly romantic, whilst a broad creek filling nearly the width of this valley of precipices, meandered with it; the bed of this creek, was in most places almost dry, so that we travelled some miles upon beds of gravel. At one place, on passing up the side of a precipitous, volcanic hill, I saw a very great quantity of handsome Geods of Calcedony, scatteredchief plaza looking eastward, including the fountain The Parroquia, a fine church, and a small part of   St Domingo east of it. A crowd of idle male and female spectators soon assembled around me bobbing continually their ugly phiz's directly in my face, so as interrupt, and intercept the view I was sketching -- presently two officers in military uniform, arrested me, and proceedded with me to an Alcalde's office, at the left base of the Governors' Palace. He wished to know  if I had a permit to sketch, I informed him that I had from the Praefectas' Clerk; upon which he discharged me and sent an officer (in uniform) to accompany me to my former seat on the Plaza, who stood by me with drawn sword, and like a gallant man kept men, women, and boys, at full bey, until I had finished my task, when he left me with a polite bow, &c. No 30, represents that sketch on the chief plaza. This plaza is almost always densely crowded by  all grades and classes of people, who stare as much as Americans, as though they were Bedouin Arabs; No 31. is a red sand stone fountain, which I sketched in the Southern port of the city at the head of the Allamo                                           walk before described.It is much of the time crowded by visitors for water, No 32. is the chief market plaza; upon this plaza are numerous Doric pillars, well finished from red sand rock, it is intended in time to place a roof upon them so as to shelter the market to be held therein. This view is looking north, at the present time the markets are held around the principal building. A good cup of coffee can be had here for a Mordeau 6 1/4 ct and mellons with many other things proportionably cheap. At this date 25th March, water mellons &c. are plentiful and cheap; the markets appeared flush with delicious fruits, oranges, mellons, cantelopes, bannannas, &c. etc; but no apples or peaches; no walnuts, chesnuts, or hickory nuts, yet similar though better than the market of Tampico. The scenery about San Louis Potosi is in places romantic and interesting when combined with the distant mountain scenery of the Southwest; the contrast of mud huts with splendid edifices and the superb residences of the wealthy are very striking and is the first thing to be observed by every traveller. At this place, they are decidedly hostile to theAmericans, partly I presume from the late war and in part from religious education. At evening the  Host, or priests, pass around in a fine carriage, drawn by mules; before which a number are seen walking, each carrying his candle, whilst several small bells, are tinkling to the heavy toll of deep tone'd bells of the Sanctuary every person male, female, young & old, must Kneel to  the host whilst passing This is a strict religious  ceremony, the nonobservance of which brings at once  upon the head of the disobedient immediate dangers  either in being stoned, or possibly something worse,  besides inculcating the ill will of the observers. In  San Louis, though there are English, French, and  some Americans, yet they are much more strict  in Religious observances than in Tampico, and  Americans should be more on their guard in  passing into the interior of Mexico and westward. As near as I could ascertain, the population of  San Louis Potosi, is about 75 thousand. The proportion of which are illitterate Mexicans of the Indian  race, called Mexican Indians. They are usually clothed  indifferently, live similar in mud huts, upon mud  floors, andlead a servile life, or one of complete indolence. Our Company remained 3 days in San Louis in order to purchase some fresh Animals, shoe others, and prepare for our further progress to Mazatlan. The two divisions with others joined in order to leave Potosi together, so as to make a display of arms, as we were informed that 70 armed guerrillas had preceeded us to the mountain passes in order to rob us, as it was currently reported here that we were in posession of a large amount of gold, and going to California to remain. It is well known that a large population of robbers live in San Louis Potosi, whose chief business is to watch and rob travellers, which makes robberies every day affairs in this country. The Mexican Indian population of this part of the Republic, seeing the monopolies of the government, have rebelled and endeavored to first down the present government with that pretext, and at the same time committing gross outrages and robberies under that cloak, by themselves. I am not aware of any Hotel in the American style existing in the whole city of San Louis, Masons or public houses exist there, which consists of squarefor at least a half mile upon the pass, No 33. is a hasty sketch taken offhand in passing a part of this interesting valley, having a large gravel bed in the foreground No 34. is a sketch of curious mountain looking west, from the summet of a gently sloping prairie hill, after having ascended from the narrow passes, and large hills on the east to this much more elevated country. In the afternoon we came upon an extensive open prairie with a gentle slope of miles, without timber and covered with parched grass, so that there was no shade, with an abundance of dust flying in considerable clouds. Several times during the day, Mexicans, richly dressed, and well mounted upon firey steeds, would ride into our ranks, bow politely, talk for a time, and then disappear, we judged them to be the guerrilla spies, and took good care to show them our determination and strength of arms. Just before sunset we arrived at the Hacienda of Tepetate, the proprietor being hostile to the Americans, would not permit us to occupy the Mason, so that we were compelled to camp out not withstanding the night proved to be very cold; we raised our camp fires, and soon prepared excellent though plain suppers, which took their usual round in messes. A strict guard was set, and the1849. March. night passed off without molestation, although anticipated before sunset I took sketch No 35 of Tepetate Hacienda. (Monday)  26th  Day clear and warm. Commenced March this morning at 6. O clock. The scenery ahead was extensive, pretty, and interesting. Several of our men were on the  sick list to day, but nothing very serious, except one man who had his arm broken some days back of San Louis Potosi, but he is now rapidly improving. Our journey today extended 18 leagues, the same as yesterday and one horse lost on this days' march, on every day event with the numerous trains on this route to Gaudalaxara. During the day we passed over a hilly country and  then upon a gently rolling country covered with immense fields of wild cactus, prickly pears, and other thorny plants usually from 5 to 10 feet in height, and often extending thus as far as the eye could reach, without any relief of other plants, &c. I found some pretty specimens of Chalcedony by the way. At evening we arrived at the Hacienda of Novelia, about 100 miles from Potosi. A pretty green valley was spread out on the right, and a similar valley to the left, whilst we descended upon the rocky side of the hill as inNo. 36 into the right hand valley facing the southwest, we camped again in front of a Mason, and they were still hostile towards us. At night a cloud dark as Egypt rol'd o'er us from the North West, with a short but heavy shower, accompanied with heavy thunder and lightning. Our baggage escaped by being carried under shelter, and we passed a very uncomfortable night. About eleven at night when darkness reigned in blackness, a noise like stampeeding or stealing  our horses and mules took place. 7 or 8 of our party immediately proceeded to search for the intruders with loaded arms, but found none there except our mule drivers; An hour after some alarm was created by hearing about 40, reports similar to the firing of guns in quick succession over in the next valley; we were however ready for any guerrillas or other intruders, but they did not trouble us further, as we fired salutes a number of times which echoed along the valley like sober precautions. [*Tuesday 27th*] Day clear and warm. Commenced our march at 6. O. clock, and crossed extensive open, dusty, and hot prarie plains. By eight in the morning the Sun generally gets warm and quite hot by nine, which continues until the customary evening breeze springs up from 12 to 5. O. clock.About noon we passed a romantic village where I sketched the church in No 37. but did not think to learn the name of the village as I was much in the rear when I drew it, besides being attacked by a noisy pack of wolfish dogs. To day we began to find plenty of palatable fruit upon the prickley pear plants that were very abundant on our way; which became more ripened as we advanced. We passed around the base of a lofty and barren rocky mountain into a magnificent valley, where could be seen many handsome Haciendos, ranches little lakes walled up, with strong stone breastwork, extensive fields under good cultivation, some of which were irigated by fresh running streams, woodlands, a small meandering river, orange-groves, and other marks of civilization, besides another long and very beautiful village, along a broad and shady road, very unlike what we had seen since leaving San Louis Potosi. It was really an extensive or far reaching valley of civilization handsome ranches, and a garden spot, among the barren praries and mountains of Central Mexico. Rabbits (with long ears and) of uncommon size, were very plentiful, 7 and 8 have been started at a time, of course we made some fine meals from them; A fine fresh breeze blows yet each afternoon from the Gulf of Mexico but in a few more days we are told that it will blow from the Pacific Ocean, towards the east each afternoon at the same time though opposite to that from the Gulf of Mexico. Before Sun set we landed at a rancho called \"San Nicholas\" a dilapidated rancho unlike much of this fine valley which I sketched as in Number 38. here some of our party were in to bathe, though the water was cold, being considerably elevated; water mellons, eggs, &c. were abundant and cheap, and the mellons of excellent quality. Notwithstanding we might here occupy rooms in a  Mason, yet most of our party preferred sleeping out in the open air, although it was somewhat cool at night. At this place there is a small church, which from the peculiarly rude paintings of Deer &c upon it, I would judge to be very ancient among modern things; it has however a flat roof, which is the customary Mexican fashion of building, except where they have become partially Americanized.Wedned. 28th. Day clear and warm. Commenced our march at 6. O. clock for a short days travel of only 15 miles to the beautiful city of San Maria Del Lagos, which is located down the same handsome and fertile valley as before described. Our road was broad, well setled, and abounded with shade, water, and pretty scenery, whilst we were most of the time in full view of the two opposite mountain ranges of barrenness on each side of this pleasant valley of groves and gardens. We entered Lagos city, over a small but handsome stone bridge, by a broad road, quite equal to some of our American McAdamized roads, and of very pretty and romantic scenery. We entered in double file with the pack mules ahead as usual, and presented quite a line of a military face, as each had his coat off, exhibiting uniformly red flannels, and plenty of well kept arms. Multitudes gazed upon us with apparently great surprise and curiosity, to which we have now become accostomed. After winding about for some time along the various streets, &c, we at last came to quarters in the \"Mason De Merce.\" Crowds soon surrounded our wide spreading archway,to sell us mellons, oranges, sweetmeats, etc. &c. In company  with a friend I visited the Market plaza, where I  purchased a fine cantelope for a Quartelia a 3 ct. piece,  a bowl of buttermilk for a Tolacco, 1 1/2 ct. piece. A good  water mellon for a Quartee, 3 cts. a box of excellent  preserves for a Tolacco, 1 cent and a half, and a good  bowl of coffee for a Madeau or 6 1/4 cts. This is the  only place where I ever saw Ice cream for sale. A number of delicious fruits crowded this market, that  we never see in the States, some of which we found  wild along our road. Near the Market there is a  fine large public plaza, well built up with stones  of the first class, with shade trees, many good seats,  and a handsome fountain in the centre. On the North  side of this plaza there stands one among the most  noble and massive Sanctuaries of Mexico, and usually  ranked among her chief churches, which I  endeavored to sketch as in No. 39. it is build of a hard  light red sand stone approaching a cream color; I did  not obtain its dimensions, but it is certainly larger than  any church which I have ever seen in the States, and  in workmanship equal to the finest church of New York.It rises in Lagos like an immense collosal pile, a great monument of perseverance and skill,. It has been erected about 40 years, and towers above the city like St Peters' at Rome. The interior is still more splendid than its exterior, gorgeous displays of wealth, immense gothic works in gold and  silver leaf, are suspended from the far off ceiling, an organ, richly decorated is supported by a beautiful and curiously formed gallery, Pilasters of great height trimmed with silver leaf, rise between and separate very large and brilliant paintings. Statues, here and there decorated with costly dresses, gems, &c occupy their several positions whilst the chief  Altar is a piece of work of great expense and  magnificense, [whilst] and a high arching dome throws its many color'd lights down upon the rich counter colors of the chief Altar, and gives to the whole a peculiarly beautiful appearance. Bells of great magnitude (originally from Spain) toll at various hours of the day in concert with the other church bells of the city. By permission I ascended the only tower in which the great bells are suspended, andfrom that massive stone cupola, I sketched scene No 40.  looking south west over a portion of that fertile  valley before described, and a part of the city of Lagos,  including several fine churches, and the nunnery &c, showing two important table mountains in the distance, the present bed of the river, which is now nearly dry, and the flat rooves of the city; with a small part of the public plaza. This is the most interesting section for a view out of four, as it comprehends only about 1/4th of the city, and time would not permit me to sketch any others in this interesting city. The delay of a half day at Lagos was occasioned by our horses and mules requiring some improvements in shoeing, thus affording me a short period for sketching. This town includes about 12 thousand inhabitants, and is apparently a thrifty and stirring place of considerable neatness and beauty, though in places antiquated. This afternoon at 2.O.clock, a party of 7 Americans and 5 Frenchmen arrived here from Verra Cruz, and the city of Mexico. They met with troubles and dangers by the way, and were very glad to join in with our company in going to Mazatlan, which a part of them did in dangerous times.[*Thorsd 29th*] Day clear and warm. Commenced our march this morning at 6.O.clock, for the beautiful city of \"San Juan Del Lagos,\" a place of about 7 thousand inhabitants, and about 12 leagues distant from the former. More than half the days march was over a dry and barren country. We approached within a very short distance of the town, before discovering it, as it was  situated in a narrow and very deep valley, and hardly discovered until we had got nearly over it, when we descended a paved road directly into the city of life, and dense crowds of curious spectators. The scenery of this deep and narrow valley, with its meandering  water course, and the distant mountains, was peculiarly  barren and wild; but the town had pleasant orange groves, gardens, &c, with shady walks and fountains here and there and a very handsome plaza, upon which  was the largest and finest Sanctuary we had yet seen even surpassing in magnitude the one last seen,  this was indeed a stupendeous pile of human art and perseverance; a sign informed us that its age exceeded 100, years, and it was yet in an excellent state of preservation. In front of this grand Sanctuary therewas a handsome fountain in the centre of a public plaza, surrounded by seats and in a circle of small Allamo trees. Most of the houses were highly ornamented with various colored devices, whilst rows of massive collonades, made the plaza scene quite agreeable, which was very much crowded by the inhabitants, and the market plaza was in its immediate vicinity. No. 41 is a sketch of the grand Sanctuary of \"San Juan Del Lagos.\" in magnitude and external beauty it exceeds the other at San Maria  Del Lagos, but in its interior magnificense it is about the same though still more expansive. The floor of the interior is inlaid with porcelain of China of various colors of chequered work; and the same upon the outer surface of the great dome. The workmanship of the steeples (which are very high) is considered inferior to none in all Mexico, certainly I never before saw any similar work equal to them, either in Mexico, Canada or the States. Time would scarcely permit a careful sketch of this massive edifice, and night closed upon me without my being able to get others from other positions, of fountains, churches, and a view of the city &c. As our party left early next morning no time of course was available for further sketches.[*Fridy. 30th*] Day clear and warm, Commenced our march at half past six O.clock, crossing a large and costly stone bridge, the handsomest and largest I had yet seen in Mexico; it was handsome and built entirely of a light hard free stone; toll was paid in crossing it. a paved road wound around and up the hill in a serpentine form until it reached the summet, from which there was a splendid view of the town, river, churches, groves, &c; we passed from this pleasant view into another very steep, deep, and narrow valley; from which we arose again to follow a rolling barren country of prarie hills, covered here and there with fragments of loose broken rocks, and much broken chalcedony. An Alcalde with Lady, &c. has accompanied our train for several days, keeping near us, and travelling in a regular Mexican carriage drawn by 6 mules, four of which travel abreast, with a driver sitting upon one of them, the whole affair appeared clumsy. He usually stopped at the same Masons with our company; he was evidently travelling under our  protection from Ladrones or robbers, as the Mail and several Mexican gentlemen were then dooing.about 9.O. clock this morning a body of 3 or 4 hundred Mexican soldiers passed us, followed by many women and children, the whole of whoom were on foot except their officers. At the head of one of their companies was an Irish Deserter who addressed us in the usual language of contempt whilst a number of the soldiers spoke to us in Spanish and a little in the English. They were bound for Rio Verdy, a town of importance towards Tampico, in order to put down Queros and his party, who were opposed to the Government of Herrara. During the after part of this day we passed over an extensive country of open rolling and barren praries, exhibiting scarcely any thing else but rocks, gullies, parched grass and in places an abundance of dust. At evening we landed at an old dilapidated rancho, where provisions were scarce and dear; the name of this rancho was \"Lavent,\" which I sketched and No 42, at sunset. [*Sat. 31st*] Day clear and warm. Commenced our march this morning at half past six O. clock, having only 7 leagues for the day For the first time, we now passed through a valley of gentle undulations, having a very red soil, that  was under cultivation, and appearing to be productive, along the valley there was about a half mile to the right,a high hill appearing very much like an old dilapidated pyramid, which was the opinion of several who saw it. During this mornings march, we passed through several small villages of scattering mud cabins, inhabited as usual by Mexican Indians. About 1.O.clock we descended a paved road into a broad ravine, and after crossing a bridge ascended upon the side of a low spreading hill into the town of Tepatillan, where we remained until the following morning as it was too far to the next rancho for the day. Before night [nigh], I sketched the church as in No. 43. the age of which is nearly a century and a half. It is a plain building, very large, and of an Antiquated appearance. This town contains about 6 thousand inhabitants; having a neat and pleasant appearance about the plaza, and chief streets. The walks of the plaza are all followed by ranges of very large and spreading shade trees resembling the Oak though more expansive. In the centre of this plaza there is a handsome fountain, and on the South Side of it, the town market, and opposite under a long colonade where the Alcalde's office was located. A young man from the States, was arrested [here] by some Frenchmen andimprisoned here on a charge of stealing two hundred  dollars, which he protested against strongly. Most of  our company visited him, and by much taking with  the Alcalde had him taken from a miserable cell  of crowded polution, and placed in better quarters,  we could not get him released, and had to leave him  at the mercy of his enraged enemies, and the Alcalde  believing him to be innocent of that charge, although  he frankly acknowledged having stolen 60 dollars  in Mexico, whilst in distress. Upon which acknowledgement  the Alcalde made out his commitment. The  Frenchmen (we were afterward told.) Said they would  wait until the Americans had left, when by some  means they would get him out, and kill him in the  mountains. The whole appeared like a sad affair. I felt sorry for the young man for we could not  render him assistance without endangering our own  liberty. The feelings of the whole American Company  were against the Frenchmen, who treated him with  severe abuse. He was a delicate young man of about 20.  and said that he had left a widow'd mother and a  sister in the States, and he pointed to a ring on hisfinger, and said that this was the only token of theirs now in his possession, and that at night in his cell, the Mexicans had wrench'd his finger repeatedly to get it. If he escapes, it will be by some miracle unknown to wiley Frenchmen, and stupid Mexicans. This evening the host passed around the plaza drawn in his superb carriage, with the usual ceremonies. April Sund 1st Day clear and warm. Commenced our march at an early hour. The first part of the day we passed over a rolling and barren woodless country, with mountains in the distance. In the afternoon we descended into a lower country a large valley extending many miles and somewhat of a triangular  form as in No 44. In this valley a stream meandered along which in places woodlands appeared. At one place on a low and spreading hill, beside this stream, was located a very romantic and beautiful little town, the admiration of all our company. It appeared to be one forest of very tall orange trees, with bushels beside bushels laying thickly strewn upon the ground in almost every direction with small and neat cabins scattered here and there through these extensive groves. Most of the orange trees  were over 20 feet in height, much resembling largeapple orchards. Among the rest of the pleasant things to be observed here, was a cool and refreshing mountain spring of considerable size rushing rapidly in various branches down the quick descents of several of its streets. Shaded by palms, cactus, orange groves and shrubbery, We passed in sight of the plaza; where I saw a neat looking church. About 4 or 5 miles from this village we passed through another, less shaded, beside the same stream, and near a fair looking stone bridge. Still continuing in this long valley, just before sunset, we came to a river of good size, and descending a long slope lined on either side with Mexican cabins, from a  large mason on the hill, down upon a very large and antiquated stone bridge, upon which were four square towers, upon two of which were statues of the King and Queen of Spain, with an inscription beneath nearly obliterated by time, upon the other two towers were statues of monks or fathers. we crossed this large bridge and put up at a mason on the opposite side in the little town of Tolololotlan, after passing up a street of cabins of more than a mile in length, we found our Mason. I then proceeded in company down to thebeautiful banks of the Rio Grande or San Antonio, and sketched  the great bridge as in No 45, looking north from  above on the west bank of this interesting stream. On the opposite or North side of the bridge of  Tolololotlan, the whole river pitches over large  masses of rocky boulders with a heavy lumbering  roar that can be heard for several miles before  reaching it; above it spreads out to a considerable  width dotted here and there promiscuously with  small and interesting islands, with green meadows  rolling hills, and the lofty blue mountains, all of which  forms a highly picturesque scene, which I endeavored  to sketch as in No 46. On first beholding this fine  little river, it may naturally be supposed that we  rejoiced at the first sight of a stream that emptied  into the great Pacific Ocean, and it seem'd to make  us feel that a part of our great journey to California  via Mexico would soon draw the land chapters  to a grateful close. On the following morning by early light  I sketched a part of the interior of our Mason as in sketch 47.  where the earthen flower jars were plentifully ranged  around the tops of our mason columns, containing  shrubs &c.1849. April. At this place we fell in company with a small New York party  of 8 or 10 persons, and learned from them, that one of  their party had been shot in the head by accident and  killed instantly, it happened at a bridge not far from this  place; the father of the deceased was present in the same company. Mond 2nd Day clear and warm. Commenced our march at 6.O.clock for 8 leagues. Passed through a small cove, and then upon a high plane  where there was a considerable pond or small lake, and  afterwards crossed a deep ravine upon a stone bridge by a  small village, a place noted for robberies &c. and from thence  proceeded over a hilly and picturesque prarie country until  we ascended a considerable ridge, in company with a very  large burthen train of miles for the great city just ahead. On descending this slope into a somewhat lower country  a distant view of Gaudalaxhara, broke upon us as in  sketch 47. which I hastily copied by the way, being then  within about 6 miles of the city and looking North west. Before arriving at Gaudalaxhara, at 4 miles distant, we  passed through a small town of a very pleasant appearance  in which there was the remains of a once superb sanctuary. A handsome shaded plaza with a curious fountain,  and a tall and handsome dragon fountain at the North west  suburbs of the town,on this plaza sweet meats, lemonade, and other  mild drinks with Polka, a drink sweeter than cider, with oranges, mellons, bannannas, and other fruits were very abundant and cheap. the exhibition of which presented quite a pretty appearance as they were promiscuously ranged about the fountain plaza beneath the broad spreading shade trees. From the suburbs of this town to the suburbs of Gaudalaxhora, there is a broad Mc Adamized road 3 miles in length, with 4 rows of spreading shade trees, principally of the Allamo with others of very great magnitude, as in sketch  No 48. extending its whole length, thus dividing two pleasant and shady walks on both sides of the principal road, which was about 50 feet in width, about 100 feet including each walk, this road with its neighboring scenery and a distant inkling of the city presented quite a pretty and interesting appearance. We entered the city in double file, with pack mules in the advance. The suburbs appeared very extensive, and it was at least one hour before we reached our Mason, as we seem'dGaudalaxhara. continually winding hither and thither, among a continuous crowd of strange brown faces and peculiar scenes. Having arrived in one of the handsomest and greatest cities of all Mexico, I hastened to avail myself of every opportunity to explore and discover its fine arts &c. In entering we passed 4 or 5 very handsome public edifices but time would not permit me to sketch them except in a  general view. an aqueduct of water, at first mistaken for a regular canal with stone bridges, abutments and its handsomely finished breast works crosses the southern part of the city proper, along it there are shady walks of trees great Magnitude and age, with fountains in shady places,  and fruit plazas in various directions; watermellons were vastly abundant, and cheap, piles of them were seen on almost every little plaza, where any fruit might be sold. As near as I could ascertain the population of Gaudalaxhara, was about One hundred and seventy five thousand which I believe is about the correct estimate, as it appears much larger than Baltimore, M.D. April. Tuesd 3rd Day warm & clear. Our company concluded to remain in this fine city over this day to proceed early on the morrow. Of course I saw and sketched as much as possible. [*31*]The city is very regularly laid out in right angle streets, usually from 20 to 40 feet in width public gardens and several fine plazas, besides market squares variously. It is considered more than twice as large as San Louis Potosi, and the most beautiful of all the cities of this Republic, and second only to the city of Mexico in size. It is located in an interesting valley, and surrounded by barren mountains in the distance, and elevated several thousand feet above the level of the Ocean. A part of the valley about it is under very good cultivation and presents an extensive and civilized appearance. Every thing combined with a pleasant breezy afternoon, such as we had on entering Gaualaxhara, - a prettier scene could scarcely be found in any of the Northern States of Mexico. It is much admired and spoken of by all travelers who have visited it. Its communications with other towns is conducted entirely by mules, and horses, and all goods carried upon the pack saddles of mules. So that the main roads leading each way from the city, is almost constantly crowded for miles beyond the reach of the eye, with thousands of horsemen, and pack mules, going and returning in large companies.Near this city such scenes are really so animating that it would seem almost incredible were the number at one single view given. Dust is of course very plentiful During this day I visited many parts of the city, the interior of several splendid churches, public buildings, gardens, cemetaries &c. The main plaza, is the most splendid of all that I have yet seen in (all of) Mexico, and said to be handsomer than that of the city of Mexico. It is in the form of a square, followed by Allamo shade trees upon each side, with neat seats, and a handsome fountain in the center. The buildings which surround it are of the first class, and bear much resemblance to all the old Spanish edifices of Spain. The streets which Surround it, for nearly a mile in every direction, exhibit great displays of wealth, fashion, business, and refinement. There is a custom much used here, of covering the pavements with long and massive collonades of one and occasionally two stories in height. Almost every house, building, or edifice, excepting the finest sanctuaries, have the usual flat rooves, and generally a very massive appearance, somewhat similar to Egyptian customs. [*52*]Here strange scenes and strange brown faces, that - densely throng the plazas, markets, groves, [and] fountains, and beneath the long and massive colonnades, makes the American feel at once his absence from home, and his isolated position among the most strange of foreign countries. Strange customs, ceremonies, dress, and modes of living seems to transplanted you at once into another and different world. Go where you will, you are a stranger, and a strange object of gaping curiosity, even to the Soldiers in the Official Pallaces, who would treat you respectfully with small presents of fruits, and politeness, and permit you to intrude on forbidden ground, whilst a common mexican for the same intrusion without a permit, might find a sharp whack upon his callabash the consequence. Among the litterati and official circles of this city there is certainly less hostility to the Americans, than among the illitterate, half Indian, and Servile population, and those on the way back to San Louis Potosi. On the main plaza, there stands an immense Sanctuary of great dimensions and magnificense: It occupies asquare of itself including a grand wing called the Cathedral, as in No. 49. The chief building under the larger dome being called the Sagrario, all of which is now being repaired and repainted with superb interior displays. It is the grand Sanctuary of this city and among its finest buildings for interior displays, which are immensely grand and very elegant; gems, Saints in splendid attire, magnificent Altars, Organs, paintings, large immages apparently cast in gold, over the Altars, inlaid porcelain, work, stained glass of various  colors, beautiful silken draperies, massive silver ornaments, gothic columns, and gothic domes gilt with gold and silver leaf, until the whole glittered by the evening lights like some fabulous golden palace for beings above the common things of mortality. No such scenes of granduer can yet be found in the States, and I have been repeatedly surprised at the enormous wealth, which must have been lavished upon these religious pallaces in Mexico. judging from the time, and immense labor required in their completion; and in their superior pieces of Sculpture, Architecture, and paintings, with their mammoth bells, and [*53*]fine toned Organs, superior castings, elegant designs, drapery, massive granduer, orders of Architecture, and fine materials, which at this day, far exceeds the small and half civilized capacities of the original Mexican inhabitants. From Spain all this display of wealth, &c has originated, been cast, planed, carved, painted, and then transplanted upon the planes, vallies, and mountains of Mexico, and there set up profusely all over the land in immense colosal monuments, whilst Mexico was under that Government. From this beautiful plaza I proceeded towards the aquaduct Southward, where getting upon the flat top of a Mexican Mason or public house, I sketched scene No 50. looking North East, towards some of the mountain ranges, and over the prettiest part of Gaudalaxhara, which I selected from the four views, showing a part of the aquaduct a fine large church, a part of the Hospital in the distance and a fine long park. The principal part of the city rises upon a broad and gentle undulation to the left of this aqueduct, the face of which is dotted here and there with handsomepublic edifices as in this view (No. 50). I then  proceeded to a fine public garden about a mile  from this location, in which I took sketch No. 51. I suppose that it covered about 8 acres, being larger  than any of the squares of Philada. In the centre  of it there was a large fountain, from which fine  walks passed off in each direction. Shade trees  of great magnitude covered the square, whilst the beds were full of beautiful shrubs in full  bloom, which on entering presented to us the appearance of a beautiful shady grove richly and  closely carpeted with many species of flowers  so ingeniously interwoven as to show the  figgure of one large flower by the shades of  those planted together. This I have seen  in many places through Mexico. In this garden  there was a fine large revolving swing with 4 seats,  similar to those in the States. This was a large and  very beautiful garden and appeared to be a place of fashionable  resort. From this place I proceeded towards  the aqueduct and sketched a curious fountain in  the long park as in No. 52. From this fountain [*54*]I proceeded about two miles to the northern suburbs,  and passing several beautiful churches of curious  Architecture, I came to a large enclosed Square, which  proved to be a cemetery; apparently of recent origin.  in the center of this square [was] I sketched No 53.  which is a handsomely ornamented and chequered frame with two interior apportuents which were  beautifully ornamented and richly decorated within  No 54 is a sketch of a beautiful freestone monument in the same enclosure. Directly facing No 53, and at  the opposite end of the same pavement I sketched  the grand collonade building as in No 55. each of those  square chambers along it are intended for two or more  coffins, the door of which being closed has upon the outer side the usual inscription of the tombstone. Day light prevented further sketches , though I would have taken many more if the opportunities would have  permitted. The market plazas were located in  several parts of the city, and were crowded to  excess with watermelons and other fruits. and on  one plaza exceeding any thing I had ever seen in  Mexico, and a most beautiful sight too, as everythingwas very tastefully arranged, even to the different colors of Lemonades, &c. Many fruits were abundant here that are never seen in the States.  most of which are sold at reasonable prices. After leaving the cold winter of the States and comming so suddenly into hot weather, dust, mellons, and oceans of fruit amid a Summer heat in Mexico  you may well suppose that we are quite sensible of this change; whilst we often remarked to each other, that our relatives at home little thought that we were now feasting upon the  finest mellons in the world, whilst the cold winds of winter were whistling around their homes. I doo not think that there are more churches here than in San Louis Potosi, notwithstanding this is so much longer than the former city of Potosi. I visited several fine churches, but had no  time to sketch even a small part of the great beauties I saw during even this one day. Though vehicles of any kind were seldom seen through  the country, yet heavy carriages of a clumsey - [*55*]   appearance for the aristocracy and the Priests were quite plentifull in townThe americans still continue to arrive in this city, 40 more during this day from Mexico. Wed 4th. Day clear and warm. Commenced our march at 6.O. clock. On leaving the city, we passed the walls of an extensive prison, which was being erected of stone, at the North Western suburbs. The road was broad, very much crowded, and almost one continued cloud of dust for many miles out of the city. About four miles on the way we passed a neat little village, with a magnificent Sanctuary or public edifice, therein of enormous dimensions and square walls enclosing some 8 or 10 acres, with very high (18 or 20 feet) iron railing in front which was ornamented and gilt, and ranging a full square between delicate pillars and light arches of stone. Some of our party supposed that it was the Bishop's Palace. About 12 miles from the city we passed a tall gate; it was a high stone gate crossing the road in one arch about 35 feet in height with a large Mason, and a few scattering huts about it. After this our road wound aroud large hills, deep ravines, through several narrow passes, and for the first time in a great distance, among numerous large pines, oak bushes, &c ranging over desolate looking hills.At about 20 miles from Gaudalaxhara, I made a hasty sketch  looking west as in No 56. showing the mountains and a small part of the lower valley country, which is somewhat below  the valley of the city we have just left. This is a celebrated  part of the country for Robberies, and we were even told in Gaudlaxhara, that two hundred, Ladrones or  Robbers had left that city the night before us, on our way  to cut us off at about 30 miles out. We did not however regard it, knowing the veracity of Mexican reports  which generally had some other crafty object in view. At about 22. or 23 miles from the city, we came upon an open prarie of rolling or undulating knolls, a part of which had them been recently burned off, on this black charry and dismal looking place, there stood  a large and high gallows, upon which were suspended  the bodies of three Robber chiefs; they had been suspended  there about 3 weeks, and were ghastly looking objects, bullet holes preforated their dried bodies in many  places which were nearly ready to drop to the earth.  over them was a large painted Sign, as follows -  \"Thus the Law punishes the Robber and the Assassin\". Only a few weeks before we arrived here these men [*56*]were chief actors in some bloody deeds, about this place, until some of the government troops overtook them with the justice they merited. The number of these Robbers are said to have been about 200 strong, committing  constant depridations and murders upon travellers and many of the regular Mexican baggage trains. This scene was to melancholy a picture to sketch, so that I left it for a more fit object and about 3. miles further west, as in sketch No 57. I copied a peculiar mountain and small village, to the right of which our road continued its torturous course. In the afternoon as we descended into a third interesting valley, our mountain scenery became extensive, very lofty, and peculiarly wild, moreso than we had yet seen them. Upon the right and upon the left were seen towering mountains, with immense barren cliffs above cliffs, and their numerous rugged woodless spears rising high in the air like collosal ruins of pyramids of yet untold of magnitude. To the west this great triangular valley tapered to our interesting focus, at the far point of which the sun was setting amid a few light and beautiful clouds.whilst the mountains diminished gradually as they receded in the background, all of which formed quite an intersting and beautiful landscape view though very wild. We then descended a hill into the lower valley, and took quarters for the night in a mason, beside the church on the market plaza of the town of Amattitan, being about 40 miles from Gaudalaxhara. Before dark I ascended a high precipice of rocks east of the market plaza, and sketched No 58. showing the square, the big walled spring facing the market, part of the church, part of the town of Amattitan, with its shade trees, with a part of the valley, and the mountains on the western horizon. Here we found plenty of mellons and other fruits all which were quite cheap. Our company here numbered over fifty. A part of them sat by moonlight under the broad archway of the gate of our mason, until 9. O. clock singing in concert, the national songs of America, some 60 or 70 Mexicans, crowded around them seemingly much delighted. About 9.O. clock a Mexican having stolen a purse, from Mr Hassan, was persued and shot at by him, which scattered the rest in short metre.The Alcalde, called next morning and commeded Mr Hassans' course, by saying that he wished Mr H. had killed the thief; it appears that he was wounded, but got off with the bead purse. We were informed at Gaudalaxhara, that this town was, and had been a celebrated rendezvous for the mountain Robbers. &c. [*Thurs'd. 5th*] Day warm and clear. Left Amattitan by early sun rise, and continued our march North west across the valley, among rolling hills of gentle slopes, having small rancho's here and there at short periods; this days road was peculiarly interesting in its scenery we saw to day many fields of the maguay plant ranging over many gentle hills, and upon some of the few fertile spots along the wild mountains base. They make a mild drink from it called  Polka, also the Ardiente, which is stronger than  whiskey, which I believe is made from the magauy also. About 11.O. clock A.M. we passed through Tekelah a town of some importance, noting perhaps 4000 inhabitants. It had a fine shady plaza, upon which stood a very large and antiquated church. On the plaza, fruit appeared in great abundance, andgoing through their usual ceremonies. fruits were abundant and 18, oranges were  bought here for a Madeau or 6 1/4 cts. Orange groves compose the  chief shade of the town. Several very large springs or rather small creeks, breakout of the hills east of the town square, and meander in rapid streams through several of the streets. The water was of a slightly milky cast, and an unpalatable limestone taste. At night the moon rose full and clear, with an occasional flitting cloud, and a gentle breeze. This night a band of 40 Mexicans, all [each] well armed with muskets, pistols, swords, and knives; - presented themselves in double file at the gate of our Mason, or Hotel; and demanded quarters there for the night. Our landlord believing them to be robbers told us to prepare our arms for service, which we did in a few minutes. The Landlord then told them through their captain, that his apartments were all full, and that they could not have quarters in his Mason, to which their captain answered that they would come in in defiance of him and those within. The gate of the Mason which was very broad, and of one expansive arch; the doors of which being open, the Robbers drew themselves up in a compact body immediately before it on the pavement and street. Our landlord stepping forward told them that they must wait a short time until he could see further about his accomodations. But he immediately passed out by another way from his Mason, in pursuit of the Alcalde of the town, who in a short time came with him to our quarters. The Alcalde enquired of their captain who they were, where from be. They answered that they were government soldiers; He then demanded of their captain, their passport as government soldiers, - but they could show none besides the said company acknowledged having travelled on two days, which by the laws of Mexico, no government troops, are permitted to travel. By their dress superabundance of arms, and statements the Alcalde judged them to be a band of ladrones or Robbers, following us, and not improbable that they were a detachment of a larger body, sent in town as government troops, in order to stop overnight in the walls of our Hotel to take us by surpriseand most probably after stealing our arms, then to attack the town, which is a common occurrence in many parts of Mexico. The Alcalde told us that he believed them to be Robbers. He evidently feared them. He told us to see that our arms were all in order and ready for execution in case we were attacked. Its a matter of course all our men were prompt in self defence, and with our guns, pistols, and knives, in hand and about us, we drew up in order, compactly before the door, facing the Robbers, who stood quietly facing and viewing us as mute as a posse of terrified owls; the Alcalde and our landlord refused them admittance into our Mason, but they would have entered by force had not our company presented a bolder front, headed by Capt Grant, of Philadelphia; who told them that they should not enter, except at the peril of their lives, at the same time every trigger was ready to tell. A moment of suspense, and they decamped in quick step up to the town plaxa, where they were permitted to stay by the authorities. After this the Alcalde came several times to ourquarters, telling us to put on extra guards, which we did, even upon the high walls, in order to stand sentinel over our horses as well as our other property, and persons. The Alcalde told us that there was a probability of either our company or the town being attack'd during the night, and wished us to promise that in case the town was attack'd by them, to assist the citizens and his little military force in putting down the Robbers, which we promised, and on the other hand he told us that if the attack should be directed first towards us, his people should assist us, but that we must not mistake and fire upon a religious procession of the citizens which would pass our Mason about 3 O. clock in the morning. This was an evening long to be remembered from many circumstances. It was a most beautiful moonlight night, and now and then a gentle breeze played fitfully from the beautiful lake of Madalena; My turn among the sentinels came from 12 to 2 O clock in the morning; and my positions around the high walls, and the expansive enclosed yards, was pleasant and romantic during so pleasant a night as this; seeming at times like a dream, that I were facing therounds of some ancient castle and looking down among the  dark shades of the groves around slumbering in silence beneath the full and magic moon. I stood upon the house top, meditating upon the beautiful Lake of Madalena, the mountains, standing off in deep shadows, the many flat rooves, the groves and the rocky cliffs near the town; about 2. O. clock a procession of the citizens took place; proceeding from the church and passed our Mason. It was headed by richly robed priests, who were chanting solemn airs; a full sized wax figure of our Savior, of full size, clothed in mourning with a crown of thorns, representing Him as passing up to Mount Calvary, whilst before Him were carried several hundred candles, with several hundred Mexican ladies following each with candles, accompanied with an excellent band of music, the whole was a peculiar scene. Before day light those Ladrones or Robbers before named had all disappeared, having preceeded us on our road through a formidable mountain and vastly grand ravine country, of deep cavernous valleys, suiting such a class of beings.1849 April 6th bay warm and clear. Commenced our march at  half past six o clock, winding our way around that beautiful and interesting lake of Madalena. Formidable mountains appeared in full view and an immense country of sugar loaf hills, sharp peaks, several hundred of which might be seen at one view from elevated positions, at times we passed over a graded road, upon which considerable pains had been taken, about 10 A.M. we descended into a very deep and curious valley of about two miles in width, passing down which it spread out to higher rolling hills with very deep chasms for water passing around these hills and amongst them variously. About 12  meridian I sketched Scene No 63 which was a large Hacienda, westward appeared very large mountains, between which and the Hacienda one several tortuous ravines, the deepest and most awfully grand that I ever saw, being more like immense caverns than ravines. through which we passed about 15 miles. They are called the \"Baranca's\". a road descends upon the  almost perpendicular face of one of them, which is very tortuous and romantic; as you might see the train quite beneath us.winding their way far down the deep cavernous  valley of the Baranca's; as in No 64. with high and  barren Mountains, sparcely timbered towering far above  these numerous deep Barancas. Passing along these  deep narrow vallies, we crossed several times a rapid  creek of some magnitude, over which in many places  high brown rocky cliffs, and various timbers,  bend gracefully over its romatic and noisy waters. No 65. is a sketch passing down the creek in this valley. No 66. do a short distance north west of the former sketch,   with high frowning bluffs of brown rocks. No 67. is another  passing father down the stream, where the road ascends  and again descends to the creek; after fording which  upon rocks [upon] from which the water was bounding  away rapidly; we ascended upon the opposite side,  where a small race of water descended to a pleasant  little dwelling, about which fine timber, several  species of very high cactus, and underbrush with luxuriant  grass were seen forming a highly picturesque  and romantic view. But our train passed so rapidly  that I was much in the rear with my last sketches,  and had to omit this pretty scene for one whichfollowed shortly after as in sketch no 68 where we came to  the junction of apparently three triangular vallies, or deep passes of the Barancas, and the junction of the two fine streams of fair water. At this place there was a pleasant Rancho over the creek, with little groves of oaks, pines, cactus, Bannannas, and beautiful green meadows. Our train turned round and up the left hand valley. And presently  came to scene as in No 69, very high, barren, and steep mountains of almost no timber, arose high in the air, with slight misty clouds around their summets; upon the side of one of them a road was seen ascending which is a view of a part of a graded road, cut over this great mountain by some foreigners at an immense cost, and in most places blown through the solid rock, and of excellent workmanship. In this little valley there was a mill of some kind in operation with a large horizontal wheel. I was afterwards told for the purpose of washing out the silver ore beneath the road, seen on the mountainside, there is a small and pleasant village, in which there is an abundance of fine fruits and surrounded by extensive green fields, meadows, groves, and fine timbers along the stream that meanders through its valley, that spreads  out to a ---triangular cove, dotted with several pleasant Rancho's, No 70. is a sketch taken on entering this pleasant cove where the village was located. After leaving the village we commenced ascending the mountain road. Time would not permit me to sketch as much as I desired, No 71. shows the workmanship on our fine road over, one of the most formidable mountains in Mexico, it is cut out of the rocks, and walled paved and graded thus all the way up this mountain for a distance of six miles. and as great a piece of work of its kind, as any that I know of in the U States of America. No 72. is another sketch farther up this fine road. The view from the Summet of this mountain looking eastward was fine indeed; including many a green and beautiful valley and more mountains, peaks, knolls, hills, vallies, dales, coves, and verdant spots, blended with wildness and prarie hills, than I had ever yet seen in all Mexico; and was really grand beyond description. The mountains far east about Gaudalaxhara could be seen like smoky shadows of deep blue mist. It is said that we have ascended to day, more than  7000 feet, above the deep Barancas through whichwe have just passed; and still a peak arises to our right, around which we wound our tortuous way looking over walls, that looked straight down upon abyss's that were quite beneath us thousands of feet. I found enough here for days of sketching, over which we passed rapidly as it was a region said to be well filled with Robbers, and frequent to many scenes of bloodshed, robbery, and other vile deeds; a few desperate men in these wild mountain passes could doo much harm even to a  large party. On the summit there is a rude breastwork evidently thrown up for that purpose. Cliffs of huge brown rocks here hang over frightful debths and thousands of deep ravines cut deep into and down the rugged mountain. This is our highest elevation  in crossing Mexico, we have gradually ascended 7000 feet to the Barancas, and about 7000 feet again to the summet of this grand dividing ridge of Mexico, making in all an elevation of about 14000 feet above the levil of the Sea. Upon this height we now have the afternoon winds from the Pacific Ocean; and from this forward to the Pacific each day, blowing uniformly from the west, and sometimes very strongly.We now commence our gradual descent toward the Pacific Ocean, an event of some interest to us of course; leaving the scenes east of the great Cordilleres, for those descending gradually into the mild and fertile vallies on the  great western side of this distinguished mountain. No 73. is a sketch of the first scene descending into  a beautiful and fertile valley, along which are plenty of Ranchos, several small villages, several sugar  mills, fine farms, meadows, groves, and plenty of small Mexican dwellings, shaded by Bannanas, Plantains, or perhaps the Allamo, or at times the spreading oak. A pleasant stream of water meandered along this  valley, the margin of which was thickly interwoven with brushwood, wildflowers, and followed by pleasant green meadows, which contrasted in a striking manner with the shadeless, and wild barren mountains; that were broken and rudely tossed into the high air as the fierce storms would toss the waters of the mighty ocean; and as rudely wild, and void of vegetation or timber in many places. This day we have made a march of 54 miles, and arrived at our Mason in the town of [Eastlan ?] a hour after sun set. It appeared to be a fine largetown; at sun set I sketched Eastlan at a distance of a few miles to the  east, being in advance of a part of our train, which during this day got much scattered on the way. There was a fine large Church in this town, with a large shaded plaza or public square, upon which there was a grand display of many  kinds of fruits, drinks &c. including watermellons, Oranges, Bannanas, &c. &c. with Lemonade; Polka, etc. A grand procession of the virgin Mary took place, this evening parading in large crowds the various streets of the town with hundreds of Ladies and Gentlemen each in procession, carrying their separate candles. The immage of the Virgin, was of full size, richly dressed in dark silks, and carried in a handsome Sedan; Other processions took place during  the evening; but I did not see all of them. This is a beautiful town of several thousand inhabitants; the houses are improving, are much neater, larger, and the people becoming much more refined and civilized than many of those before passed; Western Mexico, is well known to be the most refined and civilized portion of that country. We were much pleased with the decided improvement of whitewashing and other displays of taste in this place.No 74. is a hasty sketch of Eastlan and its surrounding mountains. The valley in which it is situated, descends gradually westward towards the Pacific Ocean; and is under good cultivation with pleasant Ranchos', several small villages &c. [*April 7th*] Day warm and clear; with an afternoon breeze from the  Pacific. Commenced our march at sun rise; and proceeded along the meanderings of a pleasant creek; that traversed this interesting valley. A few miles west of Eastlan we passed through a town of considerable size, within which there was a handsome shaded plaza, with a large, curious, and antiquated church. This town was also much shaded by Bannana and Orange groves and a greater part of the houses were very genteel. Here some of our company obtained excellent cups of chocolate &c. Many kinds of fruit were likewise abundant in this place. By the way, as we have before frequently seen, were erected several small shrines of some 8 or 10 feet square, in each of which was suspended the  cross, and around which were wreaths of roses, natural and artificial, with candles partly burned, and other things belonging to their religious ceremonies. These with lone cross's are to be seen plentifully throughoutMexico, and either mark a place of worship, or the spot where some individual has [been] met with an untimely  end. Proceeding down this pleasant valley and winding around various spurs of the wild mountains, that  rear'd their rugged heads upon either side of us, we at 15 miles from Eastlan opened upon a view as in No. 75, with the appearance of a volcano to the right hand. The creek that before travelled rapidly a rocky bed, now joined with other water courses in passing through a ravine or narrow channel of great debth. We now passed over immense fields of wildest volcanic rocks that at some period had been partly fused, and thrown up in rugged masses exceeding any description; extending thus for many miles west and North. The appearance of the rocks was quite black; in places quite spongy, and resembling somewhat the heavy spray of a wild Ocean storm, thrown up in massive peaks, and pinacles, that were at  once suddenly petrified or cooled into black rocky masses of half fused granite &c. Such a field of forrest peaks and black [Schorae ?], I have never before witnessed. The government of Mexico, have cut and paved a road through this lava country at great expense, labor and time.The particulars of which they have taken care to place  upon a pedestial by the way side; whereas by passing the road (such as it was) around a few miles to the left  they might have avoided the worst peaks and ridges  of the [Schorae ?]. Some scrubb oaks high pentangular cactus,  Etc shaded the Lava road in places, until we came out upon  barren hills. No 76 shows a hasty sketch of a part of the  lava fields on our way, looking back Southeast. About  this valley, which have spread out to many miles,  many little Ranchos and villages were to be seen upon  the fertile spots, like favored places upon the  desert of Arabia. The mountains around were exceedingly  wild, and only a few of them even sparsely timbered by a  dwarfish growth, of scrubb oaks, pines, and wild cactus. This broad triangular cove or great valley, was traversed  in every direction by hills, between which were small and  fertile coves, passes, and ravines, along which only the villages  and Ranchos were located. During this afternoon we passed through several pretty villages, that were snugly hid  away in these little vallies, and after passing over   a number of rolling hills, we ascended a mountain  to the north, where we encamped at Rancho Ocott.a few hundred yards from this rancho I sketched scene No 77. looking back Southward upon that great valley of vallies, over which we had just passed; from a height of about two thousand feet. I then passed on up the road 2 miles with a friend, and from a height looking into a vast ravine of perhaps 8 or 10 hundred feet, I sketched scene No 78. looking South west. Showing two great mountains rising in a part of the valley before named; a large stream of water was leaping and bounding off from cliff to cliff down this immense ravine, the sound of which could be heard a considerable distance; whilst it was closely shaded by tall timbers, that rose up the steep sides of the abyss, near to its summet edge. During this day we have seen back in the valley several fine falls of water from 5 to 60 or 70 feet, very suitable for mills but not improved. Along this deep ravine there are fine locations for such purposes. From this place Northward the timber for many miles became very large and plentiful; with large Oaks and pines in particular. During this afternoon Mr Slaight and Mr Jones two of our company were misled upon the wrong track, which caused some fears as to their safety, but both came into camp just  before dark.It is highly important that companies should keep compact whilst crossing the Mountains of Mexico, as those who stray off, are liable to be cut off by those who constantly watch such opportunities in the  trail of the large parties who may cross their country  April 8th  Day warm and clear. During this night individuals well known, left our camp by night, and proceeded forward at full speed, 16 leagues to Tepec, in advance of our train, in order to Secure passage up to california for themselves exclusive of our company should there not be room for all. This was showing their nature horns and all, for which they afterwards doubtless sorely repented, as certain of them had before promised to remain by each other through to California. The remainder of our company proceeded as usual not at all pleased with the rush for passage, almost every Mexican  returning; when asked, gave us different reports about the chances of passenger from San Blass up to San Francisco; and we could ascertain nothing very definite and but little that was encouraging. Some telling us that there was but one vessel in port which could take but four or five more passengers and prices very high, with poor accommodations; others,that there were several vessels in port, and others that there were none that could carry more passengers, and thus the reports varied, but the remainder of us thought best to take things coolly and as they might come; which afterwards proved to be to our especial advantage at Mazatlan. Proceeding northward on the Summet of the mountain on  which we had just encamped, we passed through much large and valuable oak timber. During the morning, I  sketched No 79. which includes Norelio Mountain, as seen  at the distance of about 10 miles to the northward, being also within full view of the town of Tepec to which we were bound. About an hour after sketching the former, we commenced descending a graded road down the mountain,  a part of which I sketched as in No 80. after which we  crossed a fine creek, then passed over and around a number of wild hills with but few scattering habitations, and those of the poorest kind until we came out upon the open woodless hills, that were beautifully rounded and moulded as by art, and only covered by parched prairie grass, and  ranging thus at random around the base of the great Novelio Mountain, whilst sloping off gently in an extensive valley, which was walled in on the North, East, and South by formidable mountains.Again, we ascended a small ridge, which soon gave us a fine view of the great valley of Tepec. We continued descending for Some time upon rolling hills, very sparcely timber with here and there patches of Scrubb oaks, cactus, etc. within about 6 miles of Tepec. I took sketch No. 81. [showing] showing the appearance of the country around that beautiful town. And before entering the town within about a mile and a half I took sketch No 82. showing a fine Stonebridge plastered, and of neat construction; on the principal road to Tepec. This road is generally broad, though not agreeable for [?] vehicles of any kind and is likewise well supplied with fine dust, which during (this) the dry season is almost intolerable during a windy afternoon. Our company arrived in Tepec at 3.O. clock. P.M. a band of dusty travellers, with long beards, jaded, and all the usual et ceteras that attend such a long journey and more especially in Mexico, but not yet closing our journey through this peculiar country. On arriving we ascertained that those preceding us to Tepec had engaged passage up to San Francisco upon a schooner of about 30 tons, that was said to be unfit for service. They paying 70 dollars, and find themselvesbesides being compelled to sleep upon deck; and even at that thinking themselves lucky in getting the chance, at the same time chuckling at us, whoom they considered unfortunate; in not having a chance to sail from San Blass, and at the same time telling us that they pittied us, as we must evidently remain somewheres in Mexico possibly for months to come. But believing that from the greater importance of Mazatlan as a sea port, and place of business, we concluded after resting a day in Tepec to proceed thither, although it was yet another week's journey, the result of which will be seen greatly to our advantage. April 9th  Day warm and clear. In company with a friend (Mr. Sayre), I proceeded this morning at an early hour, several miles out of town upon the summet of a neighboring mountain; (it being a day rest for our animals &c) from the heights of which, an extensive and most beautiful view opened in every direction To the east we saw the lofty peaks of Novelio mountain, and very many of those pretty woodless, and grass covered egg shaped hills before mentioned. Far beyond which formidable mountains reared their misty shadows in dim outline high upon the horizon, upon which the morning's sun had already arissen in his glory amid flitting clouds. The South, thesome great chain of mountains ranged with their many lofty peaks; South west a beautiful valley continued for miles,  with a high mountain ranging west of it. The same mountain  approaching to within a mile of our peak, fell off abruptly  and a valley turned around at right angles with the  former, ranging off into red hills, towards the Pacific Ocean. An extensive and magnificent view broke upon us from  the North, which I endeavored to sketch as in No. 83. North East were seen mountains and peaks piled upon  mountains, many of which were seen far above the mists  and detached clouds of the morning. Here the country  descends rapidly upon the Pacific plains, which are  nearly two days journey from Tepec. The plains could  be seen far on the dim horizon but not the Ocean. This scene was extensive and grand beyond description. To the north and several hundred feet below us, there was  a circular lake of water, No. 84. partly covered with  green rushes, and edged by high walls of rocks, being rugged  bluffs of dark brown rocks, in places covered with a red soil. This lake was nearly round, and elevated several  hundred feet above the valley of Tepec, and exhibited  all the signs of having been at some period a vastcrater to this volcanic country, but now filled up  with water. We then descended into a deep ravine, at the  foot of the hill (letter A) No 84. Through which a fine large stream  water descended rapidly upon a rocky bed. Near the foot  of hill A. is located an extensive cotton factory belonging to Mess  Forbes & Co. as in sketch No 85 .and sketch No 86. taking  two different views of this handsome establishment. The proprietors I believe are Englishmen. Their garden  of Bannanas, Plantains, Oranges and other tropical fruits, is extensive, and exceedingly beautiful, and  more to the idea of some Hindoo scene than one in Mexico. The whole scenery about this factory is  pretty, tasty and romantic. This establishment does  an extensive business. We returned to town by 2.O. clock P.M. after which I sketched the interior of our  Mason (No 87.) or public house, which was tastefull constructed;  our quarters however were not as agreeable as the  appearance of the place. The church on the plaza was large  but of an ordinary appearance, and another similar one  in the town, but a very handsome one of smaller dimensions  1 1/2 miles from the plaza, which time would not  permit me to sketch, and attend to other duties.A hasty sketch of the plaza was also taken as in No 88. It was surrounded by large shade trees of the oak; and in the centre of it there was a pretty fountain of a plain but neat appearance. The plaza was almost entirely surrounded by colonade rows of usually two Story Stores of the first class. The streets of the town ran uniformly at right angles; were clean, and well paved; the same at Gaudalaxhara, the towns of Logos, and San Louis Potosi, etc. The rooves of the houses were uniformly flat, generally one story in height, frequently whitewashed, or neatly ornamented with various colors. But the suburbs of the town, as usual for Mexico, was surrounded by small mud cabins which so much destroys the good effects of Scenery about the Mexican towns, villages, Rancho's etc. At Tepec, we met another American party, and here also 10 of our company left us in order to proceed a distance of 60 miles to San Blass, and from thence embark upon a vessel they had never seen, which afterwards proved to be unseaworthy and landed them some 9 or 10 days afterwards at Mazatlan in (distress and other) difficultiesWe had remonstrated with them however at Tepec, and there they considered their chances much superior to ours. [*April 10th*]  Day warm and clear. Left Tepec at an early hour, and proceeded through a northwest pass, among red hills, little coves, and small narrow and fertile vallies among Shady groves, palms, Bannanas, Plantains, Oranges, &c. and when plenty of watermellons could be  obtained very cheap with other fruits, this region of the country appeared well setled with neat and Shady Ranches, and well supplied with running streams of water. Many farms here appeared like little paradis's for shade romance, and the comforts of life; and many were the  varied scenes of this [day] morning that were really captivating. [except] But in the after part of the day upon the planes, having descended upon a warmer country, we were  open more to the sun, and much annoyed by dust. In making our grand descent upon the plains, we passed down over a long rotine of rugged hills, that gradually diminished as we descended, being sparcely covered with large Palm trees, some underbrush, and now and then parched, prarie grass not of much interest. The view however on descending was extensive, as in sketch No 89.Having descended upon the Pacific Plains, we were  again in a much warmer climate. We again passed from the dull monotony of timbers upon the mountains when such may be found, to a lower country where a large variety were daily presented to our notice. We now saw Palms in great abundance, large oaks, the Banyan, Beach, some cedar, large cotton bearing trees, tropical fruit trees plentifully, with many whose species were unknown to us. We passed several small villages on the planes, and a number of Ranchos. Enormous trees of a species with which I am not familiar, but resembling the mulberry somewhat in shape  and leaf, and in other respects the Beach tree, grows by the road side in many places, and being dense for spreading and of very great magnitude, it frequently gave us an acceptable shade; during our travels across the planes. These five large shade trees, are however not too abundant, and by seeing them in the distance I frequently judged our distance from a Rancho; as they are favorite trees on these planes. This afternoon we crossed two almost dry beds of wheat when flush were called rivers, but not of great magnitudeOn this days route fruits, Mellons, etc, were plentiful and cheap. 16 Bannanas for 6 1/4 cts or a Madeau, A fair water mellon for a Madeau (6 1/4 cts) 1 madeau for a dish of beans stew'd with some meat. 1 madeau for 3 boiled eggs, and 1 madeau for 4 or 6 tortelias or corn cakes; As we had found it on the other side of the Cordilleres, we also experienced here; high prices in Scarce and barren places, and cheap things where the soil was good, well settled, and fruit groves, etc, consequently to be found. About 3 O. clock P.M. our train halted for the night at a Rancho 33 miles N west of Tepec which I sketched as in No 90. The water of a neighboring creek being warm, a part of our company were in to bathe. During this night Mr Davis (who joined us some days back) was scalded by the accidental overturning of our large camp kettle, in which was stewing a fine mess of chicken, supposed to have been done by wolves, that were heard about just before I was on duty as one of the Sentinels from 12 to 2 and several times, heard the wolves, Mr D was not badly scalded however. [*April 11th*]  Day clear and hot. Commenced our march at an early hour, and soon forded a broad and very rocky creek, and during the morning passed through several acceptable woodland groves.Passed a number of ranchos where fruits &c. were plenty and cheap; and the country now generally quite levil. About noon, we came upon the broad sandy beach of a river. Our saddles, baggage, &c. was conveyed across in small boats, (canoes) whilst the whole drove of our animals swam the river together. The scene was  interesting and having a few moments (after just finishing a fine large water mellon) I sat down and  sketched the river, Mountains, &c., as in View No 91. The mountains were still in view; and follow upon our right, all the way to Mazatlan, as we are now persuing our way up the coast, though not yet in Sight of the Pacific Ocean. This river which we have just now crossed (I was told) is called the \"Rio San Diago\", being about 18 Mexican leagues from Tepec, or something over 50 miles. Having crossed the River, whilst the mules was reloading &c. for our further progress, most of our company went into a town nearby (of some size) and refreshed themselves upon fruits, coffee, chocolate, eggs, &c. etc. The town though of good size, was dilapidated and of an ordinary appearance, though commanding apretty location. Persuing our course over a very dusty road that wound hither and thither upon a levil country of brushwood and larger clusters of timber, we passed through a village of perhaps 40 or more houses, all entirely deserted, except one, which was tennanted by one Solitary man of a fierce countenance, being a cripple, who had only a few poor mellons for sale at high rates. This was rather strange yet strangely true, one man the Sole lord of a desolate village, no other Mexican was seen in the whole place, and all was closed up without Signs of furniture; the place may have fell into the hands of Robbers, or be unhealthy; we did not ask respecting it of the man, although it excited remarks in our company. This afternoon afforded but little of interest except some large cotton fields, with ripe cotton, belonging to some Ranchos, and surrounded by fences, which is an uncommon thing in this country, fences are very  rare throughout all Mexico. we travelled many hundred miles without even seeing a fence; although there may be many farms, it is not every man that has a fence, and even those who posess them mostly have very short appologies for fences, which  are rare things in Mexico,I mean fences of wood stone fences of great length, have been seen almost every day or two, amongst the settled parts of the mountains. To day we saw, as beforementioned, fine fields of cotton; but for the first time that I remember in Mexico. We also saw a wild tree about the size and shape of an ordinary apple tree, bearing large and numerous pods of the fine white cotton; And a number of curious fruit trees about the woodlands and water courses. Much of this days travels, all things considered is not by any means inviting to travellers; being dusty in places open to the hot sun, and much of the time rather uncivilized in appearance, which however is no criterion to judge western Mexico by. Before sunset we halted, after a long days march at the Rancho of \"Buena Vista\" being about 145 miles from Mazatlan. I sketched this place as in No 92. A friend Mr Custer, and I went out afar the creak near by for game, and we returned in about 15 minutes with 3 large Pheasants upon which we made a fine supper, and obtained plenty more for our breakfast, and to carry with us for our dinner, our company numbering at this time between 25 and 30. Since leaving Tepec, those for San Blass taking  another road.[*April Thorsd 12th*] Left our Rancho at an early hour. Day clear and hot; with the usual afternoon winds from the Pacific. Passed over an extensive palm country this day, gentle slopes all day covered sparcely with tall and scattered Palm trees, grass burnt off for miles in places; much wild game by the way, few habitations, and those generally of the lowest class. In the morning sketched No 93. of the lofty peaks &c. of the  Cordilleres on our night, which are always in full view in passing up the coast . About noon we again came  to the bank of another River which was partly dry, and at this season fordable, I did not ask its name, but the town of Cauponetta , was on the opposite side to which we forded. A number of Mexican women were along the margin of this river at their customary employment of  washing out clothing; one very clear trait of the Mexicans. Sketch No 94. shows, the river, town, and mountain scenery from opposite Cauponette Puebla. After refreshing  ourselves upon mellons, fruit, etc, in this pleasant town we proceeded forward at a rapid gait to finish a long days march. Much of our road was very dusty, though there was less wind than usual; our country slightly rolling and upon the night a full view of the lofty mountains of the coast.This night we encamped at a desolate Rancho a few miles beyond a river, where things had a distressing appearance we could neither obtain water or food of any importance at this place, so that most of us had neither supper nor breakfast. The appearance of everything about these few huts, was perfectly squallid, and the natives almost totally unclothed and appearing reckless and unconcerned about any thing. We camped beside the road, and huts, and kept strict watch during the night; but a few miles back, on the other side of the river we could have encamped at a small village, where all the conveniences were at hand, but being only a few days from Mazatlan, our company became very anxious to finish their land travels in Mexico, and consequently pressed each day. We missed it, decidedly in crossing the river this night, as we left a pleasant camp grove and conveniences at that place, for a desolate place where we lost two meals, and had no water either for our animals or ourselves  April 13th  Day warm and clear with a fine seabreeze this afternoon Passed through a nearly level country, covered with scattering palms; we came to a village of a squallid appearance about 10. O.clock A.M. where by much trouble we made out to get something to  eat.of all squallid places we had yet seen, this village was the climax. Here in front of a cabin, sat a wretched looking woman clothed in rags, and her feet projecting on the walk from a heavy pair of wooden stocks, where she was fastened probably for some offence. The whole of the inhabitants were almost entirely unclothed and appeared to be living in misery and starvation. Having the bold mountains on our right which were all day in full view, we proceeded onward up the coast through Palm forrests, that seem'd never ending, and towards noon oppressively hot; several crosses were passed this day; whilst this section of the country appeared very much uncivilized; and we frequently met men, entirely without clothing. A range of mountains seem'd now to range off west to the Pacific Ocean, over which it appeared that we must pass, on the morrow; approaching within a few miles of their wild and rugged base, we encamped at a Rancho called Cerauso, as in Sketch No 95. here things appeared more genteel than on the previous night and we were enabled to purchase a scanty allowance of provisions, which were in demand and highly acceptable.April 14th Day clear and hot, Left our rancho at an early hour, and proceeded along the base of rugged mountains directly west to within some 5 or 6 miles of the Pacific beach, but not in sight of the ocean, as we came upon a low ground, we passed around the end of those mountains, and travelled over flat planes covered with high grass, and in places pools of Salt water, and yet on this day we did not see the ocean, although at one time we were said to be quite near to the beach. from the edge of a Small Salt lake, I sketched some large and high rocks, which were the terminus of the mountains and nearest to the ocean as in No. 96. I had no time to ascend it, or I may have possibly first beheld the Pacific from its Summet. Again we appeared to direct our course inward from the coast, which brought us in the afternoon to a broad river, with wide beaches of sand and gravel. This stream we forded and entered the pleasant town of Rosario as in sketch No. 97. The location of this town with its mountain scenery was very pretty and interesting. Fruits of every kind with fine mellons were very abundant and cheap in this place. The churchwas large, antiquated, but of handsome finish; up the river about two miles and upon the opposite side, there appeared in full view a similar building of great magnitude, and from its colors and peculiar structure appearing to be much superior to the building in Rosario. Mountains of great magnitude were from 5 to 10 miles to the eastward. In the afternoon we left this pleasant and populous town, and persuing our way among gently rolling hills Palm groves, and vast tracts of brushy oaks, Bodock trees & we encamped at a village of a genteel but  odd appearance; where provisions were plenty, and cheap, and the inhabitants quite friendly. Oranges, mellons &c plentiful. April. 15th  Day clear and hot, persued our course at an early hour, travelling the same routine of plains, rolling grounds, gullies, Palm forrests, &c this day we passed through many miles of Bodock trees, which much resembled an orchard of civilization, extending, far beyond the reach of the eye, with many thousands of bushels of large Bodock apples; I have no doubt but that in time, the seed of these trees will be sought after  for making hedge fences over countries where timber may be scarce. At noon we passed through a fine large townand stopped for a time to refresh ourselves at the market plazas; immense quantities of watermellons were seen in every direction; Soon a large congregation of Ladies, Gentlemen, and civilized looking people came pouring forth from a  large and antiquated church upon the plaza; and people quietly on their way to their houses, though viewing our company with some little surprise and attention. From this town we persued our way over \"slightly rolling\" country of Palms, oaks, and in places a variety of timbers and encamped at night as usual at a rancho. April. 16th Day clear and hot. Persued our journey at an early hour being in full view of Mountains all day, sometimes among hills, and at others upon plains of Palms or extensive groupes of underbrush, with scattering trees of magnitude. The mountain Scene No 98. was sketched this afternoon, from the summet of a Small hill. during the day we passed over several open praries and at night encamped at a rancho of a respectabe appearance beside a fine stream of good water. April 17th Day clear and hot. Persued our journey at Sunrise in order to reach Mazatlan this day. During themorning our road wound considerably amongst small hills, and was sparcely timbered with some Palms, Oaks, &c during the whole day, except where Salt lakes had left level planes of Sand, with not even vegetation Sometimes for miles in some directions upon one of these sand beds, I witnessed to day, what is called mirage, or the deception of water, ahead. For some time I supposed that we were coming to the margin of a lake whose waters were troubled into waves by wind, but on approaching the same, I discovered the mistake; by discovering that the heat of the Sun caused a mist to arise from the sand, which by its position and  reflection to the eye caused the deception called mirage. about noon we arrived in the old village of Mazatlan distant from the present Sea port of Mazatlan, about 24  miles. At present it is a place no importance, and is much dilapidated; we obtained some fruit here and proceeded on our journey to the port of Mazatlan, before leaving this place I sketched the ruins of an ancient church at one corner of the old village Square as in Sketch No 99. Shortly after leaving this place we forded a river, and persued our course over a level ground towards the Pacific OceanSketch No 100. was taken 15 miles from the Port of Mazatlan. Those hills on its back ground are along the Pacific, and several of them stand out in the Ocean. The foreground is a Sandy plain, on which at w, I thought I saw the lake of water, which as I was very thirsty at the time, appeared quite acceptable, and after taking the sketch, I dashed away full speed with my horse, to reach it with the company, but it proved to be a very complete deception of water. Approaching within 8 miles of the Pacific, we came to the bank of a Salt lake, which I sketched as in No 101. showing the distant hills near the port of Mazatlan. At 6 miles I took another sketch as in No 102. whilst we were passing around the Salt lake. The fresh breeze was fanning us from the pacific; the declining Sun was shedding his gentler evening rays upon us from over the hills of the Port of Mazatlan, as we wound our way around that pretty lake before named, and crossing the flats, we arising suddenly upon a high ground came at once in full view of the long sought for port of Mazatlan, and for the first time a broad and beautiful view of the Pacific Ocean, its islands, shipping, and its foaming  surfs that chased each other rapidly upon the pretty beach before us. What a captivating view; two great objects at one view, the Pacific, and the port of Mazatlan  with also the gratification of now closing our land,  journey across Mexico, and again embarking upon the  mighty waters of the Ocean; and thus ending the second great chapter after leaving Philadelphia, and about to  enter now upon a third important change. All  the past toils were passed over without a murmur, when arriving here, none would of course return by the same way should such ever offer, but none were sorry that they had encountered the toils and fatigues of this journey when they knew it had now closed by land, and was about to commence by Sea; and all were of course well pleased and quite merry on entering the town with their prospects of soon being at Sea; and done with Mexico."

    "paragraph": "Having been some time impressed with the belief that a trip to California would be beneficial not only in a pecuniary point of view, but likewise to the better regulation of health and future happenings, I resolved about the 1st of January of 1849 to have my profession that of a Mathematical Instrument Maker and the eve to be remembered Monumental city of Baltimore for a trip to the golden shores of the far western El Dorado. Circumstances favoring, I made preparations in Philadelphia presuming that my trip thither would be made by sea around Cape Horn a distance of 7000 miles in the Ship \"Mason\" which advertised to leave that port several times fixing definite days of departure. Mr W.H. Ogden called upon me requesting my naming in forming a company then to be limited to 10 or 15 select gentlemen. I consented and gave my name as one of the party them numbering three, whose names were W. H. Ogden, B Jay Antrim and W Middleton, the latter of whom had since resigned and remained at his residence in New Jersey. Mr Ogden and myself drew up a notice at Mr Bonsals' Book Store, at No 33 1/2 Market Street, Philadelphia and inserted the same in the \"Ledger,\" and \"North American.\" The advertisment requesting all desirous of making a speedy and an agreeable journey via Matamoras, Monterey, Saltileo, Durango and Mazatlan to California to address \"Camargo,\" at the office's of those two respective papers, which was soon followed by a number of applicants; who were severally visited by Mr Ogden and myself. Mr Jones, of 6th Street, being the first of that number added to our list. We soon procured a room for meeting at No 100 Chestnut Street through the kindness Majors Collins and Ross, where we met in harmony and concert of action until we had completed our company and extended the number of the same to Forty. At one of the Meetings, the name of \"Camargo Company\" was adopted, which is the name of a Mexican town, to which we were first destined from Philadelphia, by sea, and from thence after having procured there our outfit of mules provissions & to proceed overland to Mazatlan via the abovementioned route. Old resolutions adopted in our \"Camargo\" meetings limiting our numbers were several times rescinded and new ones were adopted until our number had increased to forty as before mentioned & Committees of Camp Equipage, provissions, pasports, protections, for chartering a vessel &c all of whoom acted and reported accordingly. Having ascertained that the abovenamed route was infested with hoards of warlike and savage Camanchee Indians, who were committing outrages and massacring those found in their way, and that the same route was in consequence very dangerous, and believing it rash, as also influenced by friends, I withdrew my name from that route, and proposed the Tampico route to the company as the safest, most pleasant, and a shorter land distance than the former; which then being unfavorably received, I withdrew by advice, and my own impressions of that course, and then prepared to proceed around by Cape Horn. In the mien time, the company adopted the Tampico route via San Louis Potosi &c. and —Mr. Ogden called upon me to inform me of it and his desire with many of my old friends was that I should return to the company: and as they had changed the rout to the one I thought most prefferable, I again added my name. Mr Ogden was elected President and myself Secretary of the \"Camargo Company,\" and in my leaving Mr W Robinson, merchant, was elected to supply my place, in which by request and his absence I served several times after my return. A committee appointed chartered the Brig \"Thomas Walters,\" to convey our company of forty to Tampico in Mexico, which was contracted for at $50.00 each, for cabin passage, and the vessel advertised to sail at 8 O Clock A.M. on the 31st of January 1849. Four members declined going with us and three others filled their vacancies. In consequence of some difficulty in entering our articles at the custom house for Mexico, whereby our Captain and vessel was in danger of the laws of Mexico, - our departure was delayed until 9.0.clock A.M. on the following morning the 1st of February. Feb 1st Slight Snow, cold and finally sleety rain; I repaired with all remains of baggage to the vessel at an early hour, and found many congregated to witness our departure. The crowds along the wharves notwithstanding the inclemency of the weather, continued to increase until many hundreds lined the surrounding piers. A few minutes before 9.0.clock our company repaired with arms to two lines upon the Quarter Deck, and fired from guns and pistols a departing salute. Mr Robinson then presented - \"three cheers to our Country\", which our company responded to with warmth - \"three cheers to the friends and dear bonnie lassies, we leave behind,\" and it burst simultaneously from the very hearts of all. - and \"three cheers to Philadelphia\" which we answered appropriately according with our sentiments of the Quaker City. The citizens upon the wharves responded - \"three cheers for the success of the Carmago Company\" followed by a succession of cheers for individuals named in our company, among which the clerk of the Ship \"Mason,\" observing my singular dress in common with my comrades and knowing me, gave \"three cheers for the Buckskin Injnn.\" and thus did our friends cheer us at the hour of separating from all that was dear to us, to embark upon the great and eventful Ocean of future prospects. About, 9.0.clock A.M. the steamboat \"Wave' came beside and before night towed us in co with another vessel as far as New Castle. At New Castle we dropped anchor for the night, and finding a mistake of six packages of provisions which were nescessary for the completion of the captains' manifest for Mexico, it was found requisite to send Mr Thompson, immediately back to Philadelphia in order to bring on the same by express, which he did by an early hour on the following morning, and received a vote of thanks from the company. This evening was spent with considerable spirit and mirth on the part of Messrs Robinson, C. Jones and Bates; which however was excused by the company in general as they were known to be gentleman, and believed to be unaccustomed to such heavy exercises. Besides the leaving of home under the deepest immaginable of melancholly feelings. This day a vote was taken in the affirmative for prohibiting the smoking of cigars in either cabin of the Brig, the quantity of powder and combustibles on board beeing deem'd a sufficient reason. The Roll was called and the following gentlemen answered to their names, --  to wit. Some of our company went on shore at New Castle and made some few purchases of small articles. Have up anchor at an early hour, and got under way towards the breakwater. weather cold and hazy. Proceeded but a short distance this day and cast anchor 2 miles below Reedy Island, in the afternoon where we remained until 4.0.clock the next morning. Weather clear and cold with a North West wind which drove us out the bay in a beautiful and interesting manner with full canvass on a bounding sea. Personal feelings were consulted over the guard in a member of cases, and after, relief expressed. My feelings were much agitated in consequence of the heavy ocean [swells], and I left an elegant dinner of soup and chickens to contemplate the foamingbillows, and returned when convenient to finish the same, which I did in a few minutes with more relish after having cast over a full account much to the relief of my inexpressible feelings. The dinner table was left patronized by our gents than on the day previous, who were also contemplating the foaming billows with the same inexpressible feelings. One instance of inebriation occurred this day which created unpleasant feelings between the captain and said individual, but was amicably settled to the benefit of said person and any of the company, should they in future indulge, which it is presumed they will not doo, as many if not nearly the whole of them, appear to be temperate and sensible men. This evening being much moderated, with a clear and beautiful Moon, most of our party promenade the whole round of the vessel in rapid Military order, whilst the brig bounded upon the long and high Ocean Swells with that majesty becomming the bread bosom of the Atlantic; whilst the spray threw up to the bowsprit and the sheeted sides, it's showery foam, gilded by the silvery rags of the Moon, and followed in the wake  by a long bright trail of foaming ripples receding in our pathway back to the horizon.Our boat dashed on handsomely to the tune of a brisk wind, whilst the music and merry songs of the happier ones arose in concert with the gently whistling winds that playfully tuned their ocean song amid our rigging and canvass. The whole scene was exceedingly  interesting, and the music harmonious,  being sung by good voices, well timed, and filled with the deepest base voice, for a human being that I ever heard, which added greatly to the sweetness of the music; they sang numerous songs that had more richness amid a scene like this, than I had ever before supposed could be the case; I enjoyed it very much. Harmony and quietness prevail generally throughout the cabins, and no discords have occurred this day. A clear, mild, and beautiful morning. I rose early in order to behold the Sun rise over the ocean, which was beautifully decorated  with long light clouds, which partly shaded its disk and gave more glowing colors to the scene; At 10. A.M. a meeting for worship,was called on the after dark, and Revd Mr. Woods,  officiated, assisted by the Revd Mr Blake, nearly each  member attend the meeting; which was conducted  with very creditible solemnity and attention. The  subject was to those who go down upon the great  deep, with a copy of an address delivered by a Revd  gentleman to the young gentleman of Boston, on emigrating  to California, and the choice of good society. A pistol exploded from firing last night, and Mr. Robinson  was cut back of the right shoulder by a piece  at least 5 inches in length, the would though sore  to stay is not however dangerous. This afternoon  many guns and pistols were fired at the little  dog sharks, that are now following our vessel in  numbers; 7 or 8 of which were caught and hauled  on board with fish hooks and lines; they were  usually two feet in length, and bore some resemblance  to the common pike. This afternoon we have  made but little progress, owing to a calm, and  have hardly average 2 knots an hour for half the day,  Towards night clouds arose with sprinkling rain  and there was a general disposition to be in doors. Monday 5th - Up before sunrise and saw the sparkling ocean spray as our galliant boat drove swiftly o'er mountain waves before a fierce gale which changed to a storm by noon, a day long to be remembered by many of our sea sick company. Such a sight all over the Brig, it only kneeds  an old sea faring man to judge of over 30 green ones just ushered to sea in a fierce gale with rain pelting them like so much fine shot; and they bounding sky high on mountain billows. The bounding of our vessel was truly majestic and far beyond what I had ever before witnessed; all sails were tied up and nothing but the small stay sail open to the gale during the afternoon Nearly the whole company were sick, including myself, but I did not so much as loose one meal by it. I soon had an apetite, which was also  the case with many others; few however were at dinner this day. Upon the whole it was a day of miserable sickening, storm, gales and long billows many of which were full 25 feet in perpendicular height.clouds, rain, howling winds and high sea raged all day Tues 6th Beautiful clear morning, after a terrible night of high winds and high billows. To day the ocean moved in immense swells like small hills, with yawning vallies between, but the morning was clear, and the air mild and further fire unescessary. Our stove being upset this morning we did not rectify it, nor feel the need of it. The sick ones are improving and getting lively; the vessel has bounded on beautifully all day, and we crossed the Gulf Stream this morning, winds from the west which drove us out to sea, possibly 350 miles from land, and this evening a little south of the lattitude of Charleston of South Carolina. Saw one sail to the west this morning. Light clouds in the afternoon, and pleasant moonlight evening, with the sea and winds pretty high. Company merry on deck, & Saw one porpose, 5 or 6 nautilus, and gulf weed this morning all interesting to one looking for a subject. It should have been mentioned that Mr. Hewes, one of our company, lost his belt overboard yesterday containing two hundred and twenty five dollars in gold.Wednesday 7th A cloudy morning, high winds and mountain billows; air cool and winds mostly from the west. We bounded on bravely all this day o'er the foaming sea, realing too and fro, with our deck at times almost at an angle of 45, both side ways and lengthwise. The dishes on the dinner table partook likewise of the general commotion. This whole day was another of swift winds, amounting almost to a gale, which stirred up the billious temperaments of our company as usual, and there were many sick ones about deck again as usual. At 12, at noon, we passed a sail in the distance and at 1.0.clock P.M. another to which we hoisted a red flag with red star upon a square white ground, which they answered with the American flag; the winds and the ocean being  to high to speak them. They were bound to the States. We passed them in about Latitude 32 and about 400 miles out to sea from South Carolina. At night the moon rose amid flying clouds, but the air was so cool, the wind so high, and our deck so much wet by the spray from theangry mountaneous ocean, that few remained on deck long; the berths being prefferable. It is not an uncommon thing to hear one or two fall out of their berths, upon the floor, and to observe a general scrambling of boots, hats, trunks, &c for a downhill race to the opposite sides of the cabin whilst cradling upon the high blue  ribs of the ocean. Then occasionally springing a breeze. Thursd 8th Light clouds, air mild, and a pleasant breeze from the North East, with light ocean waves. Held a meeting on financial arrangements on the Quarterdeck at 10.A.M. Saw a ship ahead this morning bound southward in Latitude 29° 40,\" about 400 miles out to sea. Fine sunny day with bland breezes and very light ocean swells. Nearly all of our company are amusing themselves about decks variously. Catching sea weeds, and fifty other little time killing amusements. At 4 O.clock P.M. we held a meeting on the Quarterdeck during which time we elected Mr. Grant, our Captain, for the trip over Mexico to Mazatlan. Mr. McCrellish, 1st Lieutenant, Mr. Hughes, 2nd do Mr. W. H. Ogden the Quarter Master, and Mr. Thompson, the Commissary. It being understood that we go through during our voyage, a regular Military drilling in order to fit us for cases of insurgency in our Mexican Campaign. A pleasant moonlight evening, air mild, with a brisk breeze, and sailing about 10 Knots the hour. Friday 9th A beautiful morning of pleasant breezes; up early and saw the sun rise clear upon the rolling ocean. We sailed beautifully all day with a fine breeze. Things passed off pleasantly and merrily all day, with a mild and elegant moonlight evening; set up until 11.O.clock, hearing and telling wonderful things, which were magic charms, when told by moonlight on so mild and exquisite evening as this, added the gentle undulations of the sea, the fountains of spray, and the bland Zephyrs of the South. Saw a number of white flying fish during this afternoon, which were beautiful and attractive. Sat 10th A clear, warm, and calm morning, sun even getting hot Near, but not in sight of the West Indies. No wind and almost quiet; Ocean almost quiet; This day proved to be a regular calm, and the sun very warm. Coats and vests off, and hardly a breeze. We do not appear to have moved 15 miles all day. A breeze sprung up in the evening and got us under headway at about 5 knots, with a pleasant late moonlight night. A flying fish came on board this evening and was captured. All are well so far on the vessel. Sund 11th Morning warm, clear, and a brisk wind driving us at the rate of 10 knots towards the island with the \"hole in the wall\", but not in sight yet (11 A.M.) Came in sight of the Bahamia island at 1/2 past 11. A.M. but there being a high head wind, we lost all this afternoon and night in tacking too and from the land, with a high sea. Held a meeting  for worship this afternoon at 1/2 past 3.O.clock. Rev'd Mr. Woods delivered a powerful and highly eloquent appeal to our company, with a good effect. A request was sent to our Chaplain (elect) by several individuals, to their discredit, not to hold services on board; but it being overruled by a large majority, services were held as usual. Monday 12th Mild with high head winds, only about 10 miles gained by tacking the whole day. We were insight of the islands several times during the day. At night a black and angry storm rolled over us with rain and fierce winds raising huge billows, howling and tossing us fearfully about on the ocean all night. Silent fear reign'd in our company, but some hardened cases went so far as to make sport in the midst of this exciting scene. Tuesday 13th Passed the \"hole in the wall,\" with light house early this morning. The sun rose beautifully in a fleecy cloud of golden hue, and a brisk wind drove us rapidly towards the Bahamia Bar, the day is clear, mild, and our Brig passed 5 other vessels this morning all bound in the same direction. Arrived at the Bahamia Bar, at 12 Meridian, and crossed it during the afternoon and evening; The water on the Bar is from 15 to 40 feet generally, and sufficiently clear in most places to see bottom at 15 feet. The bottom appears to be composed of white sand, with here and there patches of sponge. The color of the water on the Bar for about 60  miles is a beautiful light Skye Blue, whilst that of the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico is of a darkand blue color. we passed Berry islands this morning and saw there, a number of small sailing craft, and some about a wrecked vessel. A colored gentleman has a very fine farm, and several wives upon one of these singular looking islands. A good breeze drove us on rapidly ahead of all other vessels. The day has been warm clear, and the sun set among gilded clouds showing us a scene exciting universal admiration. Such a glowing sun set scene, few of us have ever before witnessed even in midsummer. There is something exquisite, glowing, brilliant and more diversified with brilliant and unapproachable colors accompanying a sun set scene in this southern chime, that seldom occurs to those farther north, and infinitely above the Artists pencil. [*Wednesday 14th *] Temperature mild, high and favorable wind driving us rapidly to the South west over the gulf of Mexico. No land in sight this morning. Saw several hundred flying fish this afternoon; the vessel appeared to scare them out of the water. We travelled very rapidly all this day and night.[*Thursd 15th*] Morning clear and mild, with a strong breeze driving us rapidly ahead, no land in sight. The gulf is here of a bluish brown appearance and occasionally when the sun is in a certain position of a greenish cast. Our vessel is now dashing off spray and waves of white foam as though she were ploughing by steam. One of our company Mr Chevallier, fell  down our cabin stairs this morning, but was not seriously injured, though stunned by the (long) fall. [*Frid 16th*] Morning clear, warm, and a regular calm. We were lying still at sun rise, but a breeze sprung up during the morning which increased to a strong wind during the afternoon, and drove us forward quite rapidly. This day was warm and clear. Saw many flying fish as usual with some Nautilus, & the Gulf waters appear now nearly black. The spray is flying skye high o'er deck, and we are dashing onward within about 550 miles of Tampico. Cool, high head wind, rough sea and day generally  cloudy, a day of but little interest. Cool, wind from the North, a strong gale with some rain, sea very high and disagreeable. Saw large schools of Porpoises, at several different times playing about the bow of the vessel, flying fish abundant, with occasionally some curious sea birds. This whole day & night has been exceedingly boisterous and unpleasant. Mon.d 19th  Morning clear, air mild, fair wind and travelling pretty fair. The sick ones of yesterday are getting lively again. no land yet in sight. pleasant evening and travelling rapidly ahead. Tues.d 20th  Morning clear, mild, with fair wind and rapid travelling within 200 miles of Tampico. Wed.nd 21st  Warm and clear. Gulf in a calm. discovered  land at 1/2 past 12 P.M. a fair breeze in the afternoon water of the Gulf getting quite green. The coast of Mexico ranges in barren and here and there partly cultivated hills. very Singular scenery. The pilots came out to us at 4 P.M. and took us into Tampico by dark, being up a small and crooked river about 6 1/2 miles. Vegetation &c was all green and the Spring verdure was here in all its richness fully displayed. The breakers running upon the shore were quite interesting and our entranceto Tampico over the bar was quite favorable. The  county about Tampico is in flats and broken hope  and there into low rolling hills of a peculiar  appearance, covered here and there with dense Chaparell. An officer boarded our vessel and examined  our passports, and we anchored off Tampico in the  river Rio Paneuco. Many porposes were playing  in the gulf as we entered the river. it was a beautiful sun set scene, and the weather quite warm.  we were not permitted to go on shore this evening. We have now arrived in Mexico, 20 1/2 days from  the wharf in Philadelphia. Clear. & Warm like August. landed this morning  at 10.A.M. in Tampico. went to the city Plaza and  examined strange costoms, dress, appearances of things &c. wandered with friends about town and suburbs all  day except when our baggage passed the Custom  House, when we had all taken to private rooms  rented for our company. Our impressions of Tampico  and the Mexicans in general, was at first quite unfavorable,  but in a few days becoming more familiarized with their  very singular manners and appearances, we felt more at home Tampico. State of Tamaulipas. Mexico. 23rd For one Real or 12 1/2 cts in company with a friend I crossed the  Rio or river Paneuco, to the shore of the State of Vera Cruz, from which place I sketched Tampico, as per plate No. 1. To a citizen of the States unaccustomed to foreign life, it at once presents an oriental appearance. There are two plaza's or public squares in the city the principal one facing the  river and the other back, upon which two of the Military posts and a small plain cathedral are located. The streets run generally at right angles, and three fourths of the  houses are one story in height, without chimnies, window glass, boards, or brick; being usually constructed either of bamboo, mud, or stone, which are generally plastered upon the exterior surface, and occasionally painted. The roof of each principal dwelling generally partaking of the usual Mexican trait, though more Americanized than  most other Mexican cities. The suburbs are almost entirely composed of cabins of Bamboo, thatched with the leaves of  the palmetto. The city is located upon a slightly undulating ground and almost entirely surrounded by water. The many singular plants with the beautiful flowers and foliage of spring combined with the lively colors of the dwellings, gave to Tampico, a singular and highly interesting appearance. The mainplaza, is paved with limestone (vide sketch No 2.) in the centre of which there is a large circular pediment of limestone rising in 6 steps, upon the summet of which there was once a monument of Santa Anna; which has been destroyed in their Revolutionary events. The building marked No 1. belongs to the British government; it is a costly and handsome establishment, and is  the head quarters for the immense quantities of silver, brought from the mines of San Louis Polosi. The markets are held every morning upon a part of this plaza. It is inferior to those in the States, though more abundantly stocked with the tropical fruits, at much less prices. Beef, fowls, fish, eggs, cheese, beans, peas, yams, tomatoes, &c with Lemons, Oranges, Bannanna's, plantains, sugar cane, coco nuts, with many vegitables supply this market at cheap rates. Almost every article kept by the Grocers, Dry good Merchants, hardware houses and other merchantile establishments of the States may be found here, but some of the are extravigantly dear. The custom house stands upon the main plaza facing a wooden pier upon the river. Coffee, sugar, rice, tea, tobacco and some other articles are virtually prohibited by their duties. Our party had about $20 worth of the essence of tea, the duties of which was over $30. No. 2 is the dwelling of Mr. Chase the American Counsil.The costom house officers are in general exceedingly punctilious and exact, but a small gold piece, has occasionally induced some of them as in other parts of the Republic, to put on  green spectacles. Our company of 40. were all presented to a tall thin and dignified praefect or chief Alcalde, who signed each pasport, for which he charged each $1. We occupied 3 large rooms in a retired part of the city,  near one of the principal barracks, and a part of the  time cooked our own provisions. We saw several military parades, as large forces were temporarily stationed here,  to prevent a rise on the part of the citizens of this city and State for independence, and annexation to Texas, or  in plain words Annexation to the United States. There was a patroll of small parties of Soldiers with  drum, fife, beaugles, &c. at almost every hour of the day. The complexion of the Mexicans is generally copper, bronze, and sometimes almost black. Their hair black and straight and their features partaking much of the Indian. I think  there is a marked difference between the features and the  color of the Spaniard and the Aztec Indian of Mexico, but they are called Mexicans. The real Aztec occupies generally the lower grades of life, but they appear tobe by far the most honest, sociable, polite, and hospitable. Though, as in other countries there are very conspicuous exceptions. The Sabbath is but little observed here, church open with most of the stores &c in the morning, and all closed in the  afternoon, for dances called fandango's, cockfights and other amusements, etc. You can get a good cup of coffee on the  plaza, or at the \"Caffe de Reverdy\" for a maydue or 6 1/4 cts. toast bread 6 1/4 cts. a cup of excellent chocolate one Real. 12 1/2 cts. eggs 12 1/2 cts per doz. about 2 1/2 lbs of coarse sugar for a  Quartee or 3 cent piece of silver. Flour is high, and bread dear. Tortelias are very common, when well made they are excellent, they are simply finely pulverized corn baked in large thin wafers, until they snap like thin sea biscuit. The Mexicans do not generally live as well nor in the  same manner as those of the States with some exceptions. I have however, tasted pastries here surpassing any thing of the  kind in the States. Good wine from 37 1/2 to 75. cts per bottle. Freoles, or black beans, plenty, cheap, and excellent. In  dress they are peculiar, with many varieties of fashion, and possibly as different from the Americans (in general) as may be found throughout the whole world. A tapering and broad rim hat called a Sombrero; often a tight  [*But meals are usually charged from 25 to 50. cts. and their appendages in proportion.*]and curiously figured buckskin jacket, over clean linen,  a pair of figured buckskin pants opening and buttoning up from top to heel, under the right and left arm, being small above and as broad as a Sailor below; they are generally unbuttoned as high as the knee or the pocket, exhibiting a pair of fine white linen pants beneath, which are also quite airy. The Mexicans are very clean in their dress, in this respect they far surpass the United States. Even our servants or mule drivers, were dressed in their  clean white linens; a thing most remarkable for this country considering their state of civilization. The Cargador or porter will carry a box or package, and yet appear not to soil his fine linen. The high tariffs of Mexico, prevent  the coarser articles from being imported, consequently the  Mexican markets abound with the finest foreign goods. The cloth, or linen is confiscated if it does not count so many threads to the inch when passing the custom house. Lands held in this country from old titles is good, but that from the government is not safe. Mr. Chase, our American  consul, says that during his stay of 15 years at Tampico, he has known the Mexican government to change 16 times consequently their laws, &c. are but temporary powers of vacilationIt is necessary to have a pasport to enter this country which will cost $2 in the States, to countersigned by the Alcalde of each large town you pass through within 48 hours after your arrival, costing at each place 25.cts. with also a pasport to leave the country; A passport to carry arms, and a passport to carry any amount of money beyond your expenses, at 25 per cent discount. Owing to the  reports respecting the country we had to pass over to San Louis Potosi, 5 of our number withdrew and proceeded by themselves. Mr Grant, then withdrew with a large portion of our company, leaving us but 19, which embodied a separate  mining company, having with them a large amount of mining tools, provisions, medicines, etc. amounting to considerable baggage which the other division thought would detain them some weeks longer in getting through to Mazatlan; consequently that party of 16 organized and proceeded some 5 days in advance of us, and procuring their horses at Mr. Laflers Rancho, or farm, they proceeded with dispatch to San Louis Potosi etc. Our party after selling off some unnecessary articles (as every pound to Mazatlan cost us 40 cts.) proceeded on the journey, having obtained our horses of Mr Lafler; 16 miles up the river of Paneuco. The other party of course expectedto be in San Louis Potosi, at least for 8 days ahead of our tardy mules and mustangs. They arrived in San Louis Potosi on the evening of the 21st of March, and our party at sun rise next morning to their surprise, as this journal from Tampico, will show. During our stay in Tampico, many of our party formed acquaintances in this city friendly to the Americans, a disposition evinced throughout the state of Tamaulipas. The weather here is quite as hot as august in the States,  but a fine sea breeze comes from the Gulf of Mexico, every afternoon; that makes our perambulations about town more pleasant. The Senioretta's or Ladies wear no bonnets, but invariably shawls upon their heads, I have seen some that were very beautiful; the early evening is their favorite time of appearance. This is decidedly a great country for moschitoes, ticks, and all kinds of loathesome vermin as we will herein after prove. The States bear not the slightest resemblance in species, quantities, and qualities to them, as they are positively the most numerous and most troublesome inhabitants of Mexico. To pick off 3 or 500 ticks from your pants and coat, as the cost of a venture in some places among the small weeds and bushes, might seem unreasonable, but such is very possible to occurSund 25th  The Priest, has extended an invitation to our company to  attend church. I visited and found but few present. The church is handsomely decorated inside but has a very  antiquated appearance without.  26th No rain and weather excessively warm, and moschetoes  innumerable, and insupportable. I repaired to the bluff  on the river, and from the highest part of it sketched  scene No 3, which comprehends an extensive and interesting  range of country. The first river to the right passing north  is the Rio Tamosee. West of it is the rio Paneuco,  a beautiful little stream meandering off towards San  Louis Potosi, and navigable 150 miles for light draught  boats, through no steamers have yet ascended it for. at fig. 1  is Laflers' Rancho 16 miles up the river; west of it for about  20 miles there is a level prairie. The Mountains fig. 2.  are interesting, as they abound with numerous ancient  walls, curiosities, and remains very similar to those discovered  in Yucatan, by Stephens. An ancient city is  supposed to have covered a number of square miles  on the summet of this mountain; which has been described by Norman of New Orleans. Beyond this west by south  two peaks of immense and distant mountains may be seen  occasionally by a clear sun set.South (fig 3) There is a long and beautiful Lagoona or Lake being about 2 miles wide, beyond it in the direction of Vera Cruz, there are high mountains and fertile plains. In the foreground there is a long tract of prarie, covered with the wild prarie grass, some chaparell bushes, with occasional  patches of low timber, and skirted on the margin of both waters with brushy trees, and one Rancho or (small) farm. [*Mond March 5th*] Weather warm, and yet no rain, but a pleasant  breeze each afternoon. Having all baggage in readiness and our bargains completed for horses and mules, we  embarked with everything belonging to our party in large canoes, in which we made the best of our way up to Laflers' Rancho 16 miles up the Rio Paneuco, to his principal farm or Haciendo, which I sketch'd as in No 4. Showing the Paneuco river, the neighboring mountain which contains its ancient remains of a past city on it and the curious forest in its foreground. This is the  best house on this river. This gentleman is an extensive landholder, his personal property extends  over more than 50 square miles, which he says he purchased some 12 or 14 years ago for $800. He came here originally from the State of Ohio. He has an immense tract, stock, grain, servants &c.and raises Sugar Cane, Coffee, bannanas, Corn, and  many other things, and is the only person I see about  this section of the country making brick. During our  short stay at this pleasant rancho, Mr Thompson, one of  our party obtained a guide over the river, and proceeded out to the ancient city upon the mountain; he reports the way to be difficult and exceedingly unpleasant, but he considered himself amply repaid in beholding some of the  scattered remains of old stone walls, parts of dwellings, implements &c. I was informed in Tampico, that a large  block of stone, appearing to have been part of a monument, was raised there, with an inscription upon the under surface, below it there was another similar block, which has not yet been removed. There are many very interesting matters there for the Antiquarian: Mr  Thompson having shot a deer, returned at Sun set with it, which  was very acceptable to our company. Our party were very much annoyed by clouds of voracious moschetoes, and other exceedingly repugnant insects swarming upon all the undergrowth and weeds of this region of country. At this Haciendo, our dinners were of the best the  country afforded, including a great variety of new dishes.Tuesd 6th Day clear and very warm; our baggage was repacked and carefully weighed; and likewise assorted for mule loads. Horses, mules, and pack saddles was the business of the day Wed 7th Day clear and hot. This morning opened with the buz of preparation for marching to Mazatlan; but for many unprepared considerations, it was postponed one day. Thursd 8th Day clear and hot. Having hired our mules, mustangs and four servants from Mr Lafler, and our guide Don Francisco, being in command as director of our order of march, as interpreter, Sub Commissary &c. and our other officers being elected -- and having carefully loaded all our arms -- we commenced our line of march, -- at 10 A.M. upon an extensive levil and variegated prairie. Westward ho! all in lively spirits; the first large city to which we  looked forward with interest, was San Louis Potosi,  a distance from Tampico of about 350 miles, though variously estimated from 3 to 400 miles according to route. The appearance of our company completely equipped with with guns, rifles, revolvers, knives, swords, &c. was anything but pleasant for a guerrilla to look at, some of which we anticipated meeting. half the day we marched upon a prairie plain, a part of whichhad no timber and scarcely any vegetation. We passed a  pleasant little lake upon which there was an immense quantity of wild game, that was easily approached. in the afternoon we got among some woodland hills, with  a small allowance of very bad water. Our road was only  a very indifferent mule path, and not passible for a  vehicle of any kind, and continues thus quite to S.L. Potosi. On the way we saw immense droves of cattle and horses, roving at large upon the prairies. In the afternoon we  passed a caravan from San Louis Potosi. The road being very dusty, the sun excessively hot, water scarce and bad,  and but little available shade; we were of course quite glad to close this days journey, in camp at a small bamboo hut, on the bank of the Rio Paneuco. - and an  interesting group of dusty travellers we were too, with  a regular saw mill appetite. Freoles, or black beans, with  coffee and corn tortelias, were served round for supper, and notwithstanding they were previously out of credit; they passed very current on this occasion. Our beds and blankets were then spread at random upon the  ground in the open air; and a guard of two set, for every two hours of the night, on the first of which I served two  hourswith my comrade Mr Bods, being from 8 to 10. An early Moon rose upon the meandering and placid waters of the beautiful Rio Paneuco, and a gentle breeze played  fitfully in the overarching foliage around over camp. This was a fit time to remind one of those pleasant evenings at home, of scenes in our native land. Friday 9th Day clear & hot. Got on march before daylight and marched 9 leagues, (27 miles) through a hot sun, dusty paths, winding hither and thither over small hills and bushy plains of no peculiar interest, with no dinner  and a short allowance of very bad limestone water. This evening we anchored again a bamboo cabin, on the banks of the Rio Paneuco, very similar to the last, and found a very short allowance of provisions at  this place. A part of our party went into the river to bathe and found the water quite warm. They were cautioned  however about Alligator gars &c, which are  sometimes dangerous. We camped again in the open air. Sat 10th Day clear & hot. Commenced our march before daylight; being 7 leagues (21 miles) for the day. Travelled most of this day over plains, covered with forest of  palm trees, with dense undergrowth of palmettos.from which the palm fans are made, this change of  scenery was new and very interesting to us. It reminded  me much of the descriptions of palm forrest in Africa and  India, frequently for miles we saw no other trees than  several varieties of the palm, sometimes scattering, and  at others compact reminding one too of the Jersey pines, when seen at a distance. These palms afford but little shade, and grow here usually to the height of from 40 to 50 feet, without branches or leaves, save only upon their very summets. An American unaccustomed to such  very singular scenes cannot comprehend fully from description the majesty they impose at first sight upon the mind of the lover of the wild in Nature. View us winding our way in single file, with baggage mules in advance, with coats off, and red flannen, as  conspicuous; with arms glistening in the mid days sun, the arrearo's or mule drivers singing out with their incessant \"mulah\", the guide ahead  smoking his cigaretto, or little paper cigar, and the  rest of the travellers following like a flock of spring birds in complete tune, and merry felicity, among dust, sunshine, and the shadeless forrests of palm. [*20*] In places however the palms, and palmettos arched over our road.and gave us a partial shade for a short period, then we would come up on an open plain, followed by a regular forrest of various trees, massive, dense, and overgrown with immense vines, and peculiar trees for occasional undergrowth; next a few small hills, then a brushy plane, followed again and again with the forrests of palm. Parrots and many other birds of gay plumage were very abundant and exceedingly noisy. Here and there the grass and brush have been fired and burned off for many miles. We encamped again at a bamboo cabin on the Rio Paneuco, very similar to the last, here again most of our party bathed in the river. I saw some diminutive watermellons at this Rancho, and helped to taste one. Our fare at this place was reasonable, but charges superior. The water is still very indifferent and strong of limestone. 11th Day clear and hot. Started early for a Rancho on the  Tamouin & Paneuco. 9 leagues (27 miles) The scenery of this day was much diversified and interesting with palms, plains, hills, gullies, brushes, and forrests. Among which I saw very many curious Banyan trees, or the wild figg tree. So curious were they, that if time had permitted I should have, certainlysketched a number of them. I think it is the same species of the Banyan tree of India. I saw several  cases of palm trees completely imbedded in the very trunks of immense Banyan trees, and being quite ornamental  to it. This tree returns from its from its branches direct  in a perpendicular line very frequently to the ground  in long cords like ropes, which take root and spring up again, in many shapes and sizes, and in many  cases more than a hundred times from one large tree. On this days march we saw several curious Mounds. We arrived at the Tamowin about 3.P.M, and after sending all baggage over with ourselves in [a] canoes,  we finished our crossing by swimming the horses & mules,  on the opposite bank we encamped at a large and  good looking Rancho, being at the junction of the  rivers Paneuco and Tamowin. Here we purchased a calf of good size for $.3.00, and prepared him accordingly, for further use upon the way. Water still unpalatable. This evening a part of our company were in to swim again. From circumstances we inferred trouble with guerrillas, but the guards were vigilant, and we left at 1.O.clock next  morning winding over way through a forest by moonlight.Mond. 12th Day clear & hot. Proceeded by early moonlight (1.O. clock) on our way for Villa de Viase. At sunrise we arrived at the first- Mountain on our way called the \"Siera Madre\" or Mother Mountain. Before entering the pass, the traveller will find a valuable warm Sulpher Spring, of great medicinal properties not far from the path. As you approach the pass, the scene is peculiar. You walk and lead your Mustangs over a rocky path, of such barbarous rudeness that you may deem it a venture for a Mountain goat, and yet your horse must be taxed with all his personal wits to puzzle his way out over loose rocks that edge over the precipice of an almost bottomless uncertainty. The mules, -they are as sharp as Chatham Yankees, for they will carry a load, where a common man would want room to tout over his own shadow. They are perfect baggage wild cats, and climb rocks with heavy loads as if they had claws, or were cammels in the desert of Arabia. We passed over one high and exceedingly dangerous precipice,  and other unpleasant places, and finally passed through a very narry and precipitous valley that meandered like the bed of a little river diagonally across the mountain, with almost the slightgrade of a rail road, and generally not much over 300 feet in width, but steep and of great height with timber on each side edging up the mountains, the meanderings of this cavern-valley  with its hight cliffs, and little coves and passes, gave to the whole scene a peculiar wildness and Sublimity. We scared up five young deer among the rocks; It was in this mountain pass that from report, we first  anticipated some Mexican Indians, or Guerillas; in this pass they could sweep and be safe; and although our guns were several times fired, none made their appearance to us. After crossing the mountain pass, we came upon an undulating country still uninhabited, though in many places of a very rich soil, covered sometimes with good timber and now and then prarie grass, with occasional barrens of wild and cavernous limestone rocks. Entrances to caves are to be seen, and in one place a romantic spot, an immense well of an oval form descends perpendicularly through limestone rocks to a great debth. Some ancient trees bend gracefully over and around its mouth. To day also, I found the remains of an ancient town and the appearance of an ancient fort on our way to the village de Viase. Revd Mr Woods and myself passed on in the advance of the trainMarch, 1849.  a mile or two, with the view of arriving at the village in  advance of the train. on the way just as we had pas a  slight bend of the road, we saw five uncouth looking Mexicans sitting on the bank of a dry creek; the wispered suspiciously until we came beside them, when they all arose at once with sticks, and gathered around us, supposing something rong on foot, I drew my gun from its sheath, and exhibited also my revolver and knife. Mr Woods prepared himself also by exarming his gun &c. These fellows followed us a short distance evidently meditating our arms, when they fell  off from us on being told that many Americans were just behind. We arrived in the village early in the afternoon, and found Mr Grants division just on the point of leaving for S.L. Potosi. This being the place where all our horses had to be shod for the mountains to come. We encamped on the village plaza, pitched our tents, prepared our own food, &c. Tuesd 13th Day hot and clear, examined the appearance of the village with friends, and obtained a good bowl of coffee two eggs and bread on the plaza for 1 Real, 12 1/2 cts. We have discovered that  Milk, Eggs, freeoles, tortelias, Oranges, and Coffee may be  readily obtained at almost every place; all of which  are very cheap, except coffee. On the Plaza of thisvillage there stands the remains of an Ancient Catholic Church. The Cupola is yet in a tollerable State of preservation and 3 bells yet hang in it of a very Anti- quated appearance. Upon its summet shrubs, cactus, grass may be seen as luxuriant as upon Terra firma. Vide sketch No 5. To the right of it is a long bamboo  building thatched with palmetoes; in it the Catholic citizens hold their Service. From appearances within we judge this chappel to contain more real wealth than many of those magnificent edifices of the States. This day was occupied in Shoeing our horses. Mr. Lafler of Tampico came in the village some 90 miles from his Rancho in order to have them properly attended too, the Shoes having been brought here from Tampico. The price of Shoeing here is from 3 to 5 dollars per horse, in the States about one dollar. Here they most generally throw the animal upon the  ground and tie him there with ropes. The Smith shops and other mechanical departments appear more like burlesques than the representation of a half civilized people. This morning I ascended the cupola of the plaza ruins and then beheld a beautiful view of the Siera Madre Mountains 12 miles westward as in Sketch No. 6.The foreground from the mountain was nearly a levil plane, intersperced here and there with apparent clearings, which in several cases proved to be small open and natural praries, probably never cleared by the hand of man, as they were not much used. A small rapid and romantic river passes under a deep bluff beside the village, where our party were again into bathe, as the day was excessively hot and the water agreeable. The peaks of the Siera Alta, appeared like a cloud in the distance. In offering a pass to the  traveller these mountains are very high and formidable. Just as I had completed this sketch the priest of the parish a very pleasant man ascended the tower and expressed much pleasure at finding me sketching, and thereupon requested me to descend and dine with him, to which I complied with much pleasure, in descending the tower in a shady recess, he placed my arms around  himself he also embraced me, with much feeling, and said that he liked the Americans. His dinner was served  up in the best Mexican style, with wine and numerous new dishes, served in about 8 or10 changes of plates. I left much gratified with his hospitality. Our horses being in readiness, at 4.P.M. we commenced our marchtoward the foot of the Siera Madre Mountains. In leaving and crossing the river by the ford, it was very gratifying to see about 90 or 100 Mexicans upon the high bluffs and along the road to see us out and bid us a friendly adieu, and Adios, adios, adios, was echoed here, there and yonder, which signifies - \"to God\"- we commend you. We travelled some 10 miles this evening and camped in a wild spot about 2 miles from the foot of the mountain. My sketchbook, a satchell, and a coat belonging to Mr Sayre, were lost after dark before camping, but 3 of us returned by moonlight before sun rise and found them. Our camp fire looked really interesting this evening with the sentinals parading around the sleepers who where rolled  up in blankets; who constantly watched among the timbers and bushes for enemy and wholves, the latter of which made themselves known before daylight. [*Wedn 14th.*] Day hot & clear. Arose before before daylight and proceeded to the Siera Madre Mountain. As we ascended, I observed numerous scattering mounds, parts of old walls &c, the timber became large and dense. I believe that there is a spring (the only one from Tampico to S Louis Potosi) not far from the road to the right as you ascend the mountain.our path over the mountain was in ascent by windings about 3 miles, and nearly the same in descending over the opposite side and other hills. The whole scenery was wild beyond description. Could this road or path be exhibited in a civilized country, it would be considered dangerous even for a mountain goat; how then shall I describe it, when a painter would consider it beyond a just representation if skillfully drawn. We lead our horses up the  steep precipitous masses, jumping and scrambling from  rock to rock sometimes two feet perpendicularly. The most ragged and cragged ledges, holes, chasms, and peaks that  the mind could picture for feats in horsemanship. Reader! you have doubtless seen nominally bad roads in the States, but they convey only a faint idea of the  hardships you must encounter in passing the formidable crags upon these mountains of distracted rudeness. Having surmounted the first Series, we descended upon  similar sharp and pointed edges into a wild and  romantic cove, leading off over and around other more  passable hills, in full view of numerous mountains ranging at random in every direction, until we reached the Ranch la Pier, by a small lakeupon a beautiful plane, and here we encamped for the night, having arrived early in the afternoon. The proprietor of the Rancho, is an Alcalde of wealth, and a man of affable manners. Before sun set we ascended a neighboring hill and sketched scene No. 7. including a large assemblage of distant mountains. The setting sun cast back their shadows upon the planes, as I descended, and lent a passing beauty to them ever to be remembered. From advice given us by the Alcalde, it was thought advisable to change our rout over the mountains to San Louis Potosi, by a nearer and more safe direction. The Mexican forces, and Indians or Guerrillas, being  upon the regular route, which would cause us trouble. The first division having gone that way unadvised, they met with difficulties, detention, and considerable danger. Thurs 15th Day clear & hot. Entered upon the nearer route, and passed palm forrests, old fortifications, and a fine little river, where  we filled our canteens with refreshing and cool water, the best from Tampico, and accomplished a long march and 6 or 7 formidable mountains of worse paths than any previously travelled. To describe our labours on these volcanic rocks of gothic masonry, would be romantic indeed.but suffice it to be said that this days march was  the most wild rugged and exhausting of any to San Louis Potosi. On this route I had the pleasure of discovering a  magnificent cavernous Amphitheatre of several thousand feet in diameter, and about 300 feet in perpendicular  debth, covered below with dense timber, and overhung with high arching cliffs of great magnificence. Our mountain scenery today was exceedingly grand though we enjoyed it but little owing to the difficult passes to be encountered. Many of the mountains had no timber, nor even vegetation upon them; being vast masses of rude brown rocks particularly upon their summets. Had time permitted, I should have sketched some of these alpine scenes of barrenness for the information and curiosity of my friends and readers. They are totally unlike anything I ever before saw  in point of complete barrenness and appeared really savage. At sunset we descended into a romantic valley and wound around several Sugarloaf hills, by dark into the beautiful village of San Nicholas, where we encamped upon a pleasant plaza of grass in the midst of the village and at the foot of a large and imposing mountain.but suffice it to be said that this days march was the most wild rugged and exhausting of any to San Louis Potosi.

Whilst watering our horses at a pond in this valley, two suspicious Mexicans appeared, one over the pond, and the other near us apparently examining our arms, &c. and in a short time one of them made bold to tell two of our party that  he was one of a party defeated by the Mexican Government, and that they were many, who were now in persuit of  plunder, both of them were handsomely dressed, and rode upon first class animals. We turned to the left from this interesting valley, through a pass in the hills similar to  No 9. when we came in view of the beautiful and-- romantic village of Tortugas, or village of turtles, where we arrived at 4 P.M. and located ourselves in a  small brush school house, upon a small riding ground well adapted to defence, as an attack of the Guerrillas was looked for, as quite certain during the night. Many of the inhabitants collected around us with curiosity and pleasure, as they hoped we would be of service to them in case of an attack of the Guerrillas or robbers. We were all in anticipation of a fight, when we saw a small fire upon the summit of a neighboring mountain, supposed to be a signal light. Guns, pistols &c were allwith here and there patches of stunted vegetation, growing among the wild mountain rocks. Among these I saw a number of strange and interesting trees, curious plants, magueys, palmettoes, coco's, and a strange fruit resembling the pine apple, being twice as large, and filled with numerous small soft white fruits, much resembling in appearance and taste the common chesnut, which were very abundant on one of the mountains. I also saw a shrub or bean plant bearing flowers, resembling skeins of white & red silk, from 1 to 2 inches in thickness, and from 4 to 6 inches in length. On this days march we passed through many very peculiar mountains, scenes of interest. No 9 (sketch.) was taken on horseback whilst passing into the valley of corn. No 10. is a view of the Valle de Maise, or valley of corn, looking to the north. This valley is about one mile in width, and many in length. The hills upon either side are nothing of nearly void of vegetation, the whole valley is divided into large fields for corn, and well improved with stone fences. The soil is rich and corn flourishes here luxuriantly. Far on the northern horizon a high mountain wasall of which grew from 4 to 15 feet in height, and chiefly among the interstices of the rocks. It appeared to be a  section of country almost useless for any purpose, and it  really appeared strange, how such a barren wilderness of  of thorns could be at all inhabited where water was  also very bad and scarce; in the afternoon we travelled among clouds of dust, with a hot sun and but little breeze. before sunset we encamped under a tree, beside, a desolate mud dwelling upon a deasert plane, much like a scene in the desert of Arabia, appearing quite as barren and  forlorn, as the immagination could well picture as in sketch No 13. A large old fashioned rope and pulley well, was in the  vicinity, at which about 40 Mexican women, were engaged in drawing water, and carrying it away in large earthen jars upon their heads, bearing a striking resemblance to the old Egyptian costoms, in dress, color, and manners. At this place we fared slim and paid well for it. Sund 18th   Day clear and warm. Proceeded on our journey at 6.A.M. very  anxious to get out of this barren and sandy wilderness. and travelled nearly all day over diversified planes of  limestone, palms, maguays, casters, some timber, and for a  mile or two, for the first time a woodland of beautiful cedars.put in the best order, our camp fire put out, and two guards put on duty. The Alcalde paid us a friendly visit, and many of the inhabitants brought us cheap provissions, and the night passed off without trouble. [*Sat. 17th.*] Day clear and warm. The inhabitants came in numbers to bid us a friendly adios. I pencil'd sketches No 11. and 12. just before leaving showing on No 11. our position in camp at the school house, and an opposite view looking South. Oranges flourish here, and are  very cheap, eggs are plentiful, with many useful articles of provissions. Soon after leaving this pleasant village, we ascended several large and barren hills, and in a few hours descended a very romantic pass down upon prarie plains and cultivated fields. our views on this days journey were extensive new diversified and interesting. We came to a  small village of a very romantic appearance, beside a little stream of water, where at first the inhabitants were much terrified at our appearance. We saw but little timber, during the whole day, the planes and  hills, being almost covered with wild cactus, prickley pears, and the short scrubby palms, etc.At intervals for several miles, the ground was as white as the very snow of a northern winter, having a saline taste, in places, in others that of Epsom Salts, and as fine as the very best flour. Caverns were beneath, for we  could often hear the footsteps of our horses echoing beneath, and now and then a chasm or deep pit would  appear. When timber appeared in the usual form of groups or clusters, it usually had a singular appearance, much resembling extensive Apple, and  Peach orchards. The country had conspicuous marks of a volcanic origin upon a limestone foundation. We were almost constantly in sight of distant ranges of lofty and rugged mountains, lending romance to the day. and now and then large planes, covered with prairie grass would extend for before the eye to the mountains skirted here and there with pleasant shady woodlands. We arrived at the Hacienda about 4. P.M. and were  gratified to find it a place much superior to the last,  not only for provisions, but also for shade and comfort. About 9.O.clock this morning we arrived at a place on the valley plane, where a stream of clear and very strong limestone water meandered from a small lake, and in a short distancedisappeared beneath the ground; this water though clear and cold, was so strongly impregnated with the Carbonate of lime, that though we were very thirsty, we could scarcely drink it. During a temporary halt, I sketch'd this lake No. 12 [*14*], and its vicinity southward. Game was plentiful here, and  several of our party delay'd some on account of it. Mr Sherman, one of the same , remained there so long that  in persuit of our caravan he missed the path and  was lost for a day and a half suffering greatly from exposure and other great dangers; after some delay, expense,  and trouble in scouring the country in various directions with a Mexican guide, he was at last found, much fatigued frightened, and sick, having encountered considerable perils. I remained some time behind the company in waiting for  Sherman, as long as I felt it safe from missing the way  myself, expecting him to come up upon this path, [during that time I sketched scene No 14. a high] on our right there was a high mountain [to] [the North] bearing the marks of a large volcano. Some of our party were in to bathe again this evening, but as our journey has elevated us much, the water is now becoming cooler especially each night, which is cold enough for two or three blankets, whilst  the mid day sun is quite hotMond 19th Day warm and clear. Proceeded on our journey at 7.O. clock. sMuch of this days journey was very similar to the last, at times winding among barren hills, small planes of cactus, thorns scattering palms, gullies and rocks, with small groves of peculiar trees of a stunted growth. Before sun set we crossed a beautiful and fertile plane under cultivation with corn, and haulted for a short time at a large well on one of the fields one and a half liles from, and in full view of the beautiful little town of Ceretus de San Juan; at the suburbs of which we encamped within a large yard for the  night. Before day light had left the hills of Ceretus, I passed through several parts of the town, and Sketched the church and plaza as in No 15. Showing the valley and hills eastward, over which we had passed during the after part of the day. The appearance of this little town is quite genteel the houses being mostly constructed of Stone and frequently whitewashed and as often secluded in pleasant Shady yards and groves of the trees and shrubs peculiar to this country.Tuesd 20th  Day warm and clear. Proceeded on our journey at 6.O.clock. Just as we were leaving the yard the horse belonging to Mr Thompson, taking fright at some object ran off through the yard, and brok his rifle into many small pieces, Mr T.--escaping unhurt. About 1 mile from  Ceretus, looking westward, I sketched scene No 16. showing the barren hills, a hacienda to the right, and the little clusters of bushes, dotting the ground like miniature islands. We were among the hills and ravines all day, and passed up one very interesting pass between barren mountains which was several  miles in length. On the way before entering this pass,  and at the commencement of a fine broad road, we  halted for a short time at a large Hacienda, called San  E Pedro No 17. having westward a beautiful mountain view, south the cultivated fields and distant hills, and around the dwelling several beautiful groves, over the principal door was painted in large letters, \"Casa Particular\". It being a public house or hotel of the  Mexican order. Having ascended through peculiar scenes of the passes, to the summet of the mountains, we then passed a long time over a wild rocky and entirely desolatewilderness, almost entirely destitute of the smallest vegetation, except in some particular spots, where small stone & mud huts of misery were now and then to be seen. Before descending we passed a small mud village in a little rocky and desolate ravine; with only a few cactus, thorns, and stunted brush, but no regular timber about it. It looked much like solitude and misery. The road has now become excellent, and for the first time we found it graded and paved as a regular road up the mountain. Wooden crosses are plentiful and conspicuous, they are more numerous now than on the way back to Tampico; Sometimes two or three in sight of each other may be seen and particularly on this days march. We are told that these crosses are erected upon the particular spots, where travelers have been murdered. if so, this is decidedly a great country. As we descended the mountain, winding our way down a dangerous pass, a beautiful plane, with a range of barren mountains 15 miles westward, appeared before us, which I hastily sketched as our party descended to the plane, as in number 18. This plane is about 15 miles in width, and almost entirely covered with a brush peculiar to this country.This plane, of the valley is quite level and of very great length, the camino that crosses it, is at least 100 feet broad, and would be an elegant road for travel if not so abundantly supplied with dust and sand. Our party were so much enveloped in dust, that during a portion of the time some of them were not distinguishable at the distance of a few rods. Clouds of dust arose high in the air, and marked in places the spots where persons were moving on many parts of the plane. Such scenes have however been long familiar to us from the very city of Tampico. At sun set we arrived at the \"Meson De Fern\" a public house called Pestelius located in a desert of sand, a few miles from a village to the north west and off from the road. At this place, we found Capt Grants' division of the Camargo Company, who met us in a sociable manner as old friends, the two divisions having taken different roads to San Louis Potosi.. Mr Chevallias' party of 5 having also arrived the whole Camargo Company were again together. At night, a high wind arose and gave us a complete storm of dust, exceeding anything of the kind that I have ever before witnessed in any country, reminding one of the desert of Arabia.Wednd 21st Day warm and clear. Capt. Grants division, left before sunrise in order to reach San Louis Potosi before night. Our company proceeded on the way an hour after, as we did not design pressing our horses and mules with a very long days march. Nos 19 and 20 are exterior and  interior views of the desert house where we camped. To the right of the house, there is a large well, which is deserving of notice; two or three hoses are fastened by beams to a vertical shaft, which by 8 right angle sticks move a horizontal beam, to which there is a wheel about 12 feet in diameter, with ropes and  about 20 leather buckets, for raising water from the  well to a trough, and from thence into a stone bason  about 60 feet square, and 8 or 10 feet in debth. This water was fair and cool, and very desirable for the country. Such wells are not frequent, and found only occasionally at the large Haciendo's or Ranchoe's of the wealthy. Water on this road from Tampico to  San Louis Potosi, is scarce, and in almost every instance very unpalatable, muddy, and dangerous to the stranger. It is therefore nescessary for travellers to be cautious in drinking the water along this route                                                                      in particular. This days journey was very similar to the last, with hills and dusty roads, with a hot sun, brushy planes, thorns, and large cactus of various forms, &c. Mountains of barren rocks were seen all day, but we travelled chiefly upon the planes. About 4 in the afternoon we arrived at the Rancho de los Soledad, previous to which I sketched scene No. 21 as we descended to the valley in which this rancho is located, This plane is very wide, and a very considerable length, on this plane about 30 miles to the left is located the city of San Louis Potosi, in full view of large Mountains, though not within several miles of any of them. No. 22 is a sketch of the Haciendo or \"Rancho de los  Solidad\", and its neighboring mountain, which I sketched before sun set, this scene is looking S. East. We encamped opposite to this in a large Mud wall with appartments for travellers as in Sketch No. 23. The inhabitants are now becoming less friendly than they were back over the mountains. And are decidedly against the Americans in the popular feeling, and have occasionally expressed those feelings with insults, and a few words of contempt, which some of them have learned from the American deserters, in the English language. We have seen a number of these contempitible shadows of white men and almost as often heard their curses, or indecent language, but we have generally left them unnoticed. At this rancho we saw a large amount of arms and lances, with an American Rifle, pistols, swords &c which led us to suspicion the character of the place strongly; we however kept our Arms and Sentinels in good trim, and were ready at the word, to show them that in defence we were the same original Americans that they might have before read about. Had our numbers been small enough to suit their taste, I have no doubt but that a fight would have resulted judging from all circumstances, questions, &c. Being in the neighborhood of S. L. Potosi, it is now absolutely nescessary to be constantly on your gard for all shapes of thieves, Robbers, Guerillos, &c., etc, etc. who appear to compose a large proportion of the population. [*Thursd 22nd*]  We left the Rancho, this morning at 3. O. clock for San  Louis Potosi, the road was broad, and lined with cactus, from 5 to 15 feet in height. We were all awake for any attack on the way. Having travelled 15 miles by 1/2 past 8.O. clock A.M. we entered the Splendid and singular city of San Louis Potosi, having passed through a beautiful little village before entering Potosi. The city is situated upon a large and beautiful plane, which is under good cultivation, and is for several miles in every direction; divided into regular right angle  \"streets and roads. The fences of the roads, if they may be so called are composed of the high pentangular cactus, growing in single stems of about 5 inches diameter to a  height of about 8, 10, or 15 feet, and frequently so close together that it is generally capable of shutting out the smallest animal. The average width of the streets are about 30 feet. A member of large and handsome species of trees range along them, with which I am not familiar, one of which resembles in bark, limb, and  site, the Locust, with leaf of a small fern. Another, has the shape and height of a poplar, with the denseness of the black thorn hedges of the States; it is a  beautiful tree of a dark green color, and very ornamental. The maguay is another peculiar plant, very abundant here; I have seen fences made of them extending many miles at a time, and very common everywhere  onour way from Tampico. All these interesting plants, trees &c. with a large number that would be  difficult to describe, but which nevertheless are exceedingly beautiful, belong to this country and are so abundant as at times to cover many miles in compact masses, so much so that it would be difficult for a man to pass among them as they all, with but little exception possess luxuriant crops of  thorns. All these species crowd the roads and surround the fields as you pass into San Louis Potosi. I also for the first time saw two peach trees in full blossom in a beautiful garden at the suburbs of the city. And many beautiful flowers of singular beauty were in full bloom likewise and filled the air with the richness of their morning fragrance. Several fine fields of ripe barley added to the view, their mellow orange hues, whilst, the plough (a rude woodden concern) was busy beside. The Orange, Lemons, and fig trees were also handsome when blended with their fruits, beneath other more conspicuous trees, among which was one called the Peru, another the China tree, andyet another larger and decorated with more exquisite brilliance than I have ever before witnessed. all these with their charming colors and luxuriance bent gracefully over our dusty roads as we passed into the great central metropolis of Potosi. The morning sun had already arrisen upon the domes, towers and minarets of Potosi, as our company entered it from the North. There was so much of the grand and the humble combined, that I could not but remark its resemblance to what I had read of St Petersburg and Moscow, as described by travellers in Russia. After wending in single file our tortuous way amid dense crowds of strange brown faces, around the various streets of the city we at last took up our quarters at the St Anthony house, which was commodious and  constructed strictly after the Mexican order, and one of the first hotels in the city, though, not by any means adapted to the ideas of Americans, being very similar to sketches Nos. 19. and 20. The suburbs of the city (which are very extensive) are almost entirely composed of miserable looking one story flat roof'd mud dwellings of a dilapidated appearance which are much inferior to  the [*34*]very lowest order of dwellings found in any part of the  States, and contrast in a very striking manner with the numerous splendid sanctuaries, public buildings, towers, domes, and superfluous grandeur of the interior city. None of our company even dreamed of the surprising splendours, which broke so suddenly upon them, when they entered the thronged plazas amid the thousands of vacant gazers who seem'd to view us as some unearthly intruders, just draft among them from some other plannet. Our ideas were never so much unhinged at when too closely crowded by dense throngs of starving Mexicans, who with wondrous eyes and  open mouths, Knew not in decency where to end their extravagant curiosity. As we entered the  streets were quick ly thronged, the windows and  iron gratings filled with Seniorettas or Ladies, the doors with wise heads and muchatcha's of boys with some upon the very house tops, to the  Americans enter into the precincts of their almost forbidden walls of China. An unfriendly feeling towards the Americans was soon evident from their language  as it was a day of religious ceremonies, and rest from labor, the church and plaza was thronged, by Mexicans dressed in their holliday best. We passed through this pleasant town, without halting and ascended a steep, high and rugged mountain at the immediate suburbs of the town. On looking back towards Amattitan, distant 14  miles to the South east and Tekelah at its base I hastily sketched the view as in No 59. On ascending this mountain I saw an animal of the Lizard Species about 2 feet in  length lying upon a large boulder rock in a ravine. After ascending we passed several miles through a  a deep, [and] very narrow, and crooked ravine among the highland hills; it was perfectly adapted to the purposes of Ladrones or Robbers, and has been recently the theatre of bloody deeds, robberies, &c. Here jet black Quartz began to appear plentiful after passing in single file for Several miles under the arches and bluffs of this wild and narrow ravine, we descended into a small and pretty valley, where there was a small farm, green fields and some water, from  this we ascended large hills, almost composed of  [*35*]the same brittle jet black quartz, before named. So much so, that it was hard upon the feet of our animals, we again descended into a gently sloping valley of about two miles in width, at the far northern end of which we could see the interesting Lake of Madalena, which I sketched on a nearer approach as in No 60. Showing the town of Madalena on the margin of the Lake, beyond which that welcome sheet of water with its interesting mountain scenery appeared, reminding one much of similar scenes in Italy and Switzerland; and rather unlike many other Mexican towns. At this place we stopped in a comfortable mason overnight, halting about 4 P.M. An opportunity offering I went and upon the margin of the lake and sketched view No 61 looking west among the mountains over which the sun was setting. Also No 62 looking south east towards part of the town Madalena is a town of a shady and pleasant appearance. Most of its streets are narrow and crooked, but well shaded in general. The plaza, was of good size and had a fine large antiquated church upon the south eastern side of it. Around which there was a large crowd of worshippers,uncivil manners, and in two of our party being stoned upon the city plaza; all of which we readily discovered and were particularly cautious, in being upon our guard, whilst we were frequently rendering civilities for incivilities. To these however we are happy to state that there were a number of exceptions, among the higher classes, and the better informed, which gave us a better opinion of Potosi, than we otherwise should  have had. We were nearly three days in this interesting city during which time whilst our guide was preparing fresh mustangs &c for our further journey to Mazatlan; and having some opportunities, I availed myself of them in visiting and sketching some of the massive and beautiful churches &c, having first obtained permission from an alcalde's clerk in the Governors' Palace, to visit and sketch as I wish'd. I proceeded in company with an American friend about 1 1/2 miles south from  the city, towards the Mosa Mountain, where from the remains of an old mud fort, I sketched the domes  &c of the city as in No 24. nearly all of which belong to magnificent churches erected many years past by the Spaniards at enormous costs, and decorated  in theinterior with gorgeous and the most exhorbitant displays of wealth and splendour that the human immagination could well conceive of, and far exceeding any thing of the kind to be found in the States. An open plane of more than a mile in extent each way extended between the fort and the city, upon which several hundred Mexican soldiers were exercising with targets, drilling &c. At this time large forces are concentrated here, who appear to be preparing for political struggles for power. To the right of this open plane, there are four parallel rows of the beautiful Alamo trees forming a shady and a very pleasant walk of about one mile from the city proper southward to the front  of the magnificent sanctuary (Santoario) as in fig 25. At each end and along this walk there are handsomely ornamented fountains. No 25 is a view of the Sanctuary and Mosa Mountains from the same position, where fig 24 was taken. A nearer view of the Sanctuary was then taken from the front near a fountain, as in fig 26, including two fountains two neat gardens, and the style of seats surrounding the principal fountain. The workmanship upon this magnificent edifice appears to be a contribution of the various orders ofArchitecture which in execution I believe to be superior to any thing similar which I have seen in the States. Not even excepting Trinity Church in New York, and composed of a hard red sand stone very similar to the one named. This church though over a mile from the city was under military guard, from whom I asked permission to enter but was told that the chief key of the Sanctuary was in the posession of the Captain, who was out drilling his  men upon the plane beforementioned. On returning to the city we passed a number of handsome edifices of  singular and antiquated appearance, but my opportunities limited me in sketching many of them. The streets were thronged in almost every direction, and should one attempt a sketch in their presence, a crowd of noisy gabbling superstitious men, women, and children, would soon compell a retreat, at the risk of being stoned, amid the jeers, and language suiting degraded and grossly ignorant minds. I was told there were over fifty handsome Sanctuaries or churches in this city, which from appearances I doo not doubt. None but the Catholic religion is tolerated here as in other parts of the Republic, and in passing each Sanctuary, even upon the opposite side of the street, the person is required to takeoff his hat, and retain it in his hand, until he has passed the door of the Sanctuary, otherwise he is liable to be stoned at the shortest notice; if nothing worse may happen him. I'm entering the church during service he is required to kneel, and to accompany respectfully in the ceremonies of the church. The interior splendors of these numerous churches, I could not describe in justice within my present compass. Their displays are gorgeous in the highest degree of man's ingenuity; and frequently exhibit much of the Theatrical; in some instances the walls and high gothic roof, being entirely covered with thousands of gothic (relief) devices, are entirely gilt with gold or silver leaf, until the whole interior glitters like a solid golden palace, with richly ornamental chandaliers, lights of various colors, hundreds of Statues of life size, adorned in robes of brilliant colors, gems, in great profusion, magnificent organs, select gallaries for the paintings, relicts, and statues of the saints, in one apartment of the St Domingo Sanctuary I was shown the bones of saints, and such other things as would fill a volume to describe.On returning to the main plaza, I sketched the Palace  of the governor as in fig 27. a crowd of noisy belligerents soon manifested a a jeering aspect, which compelled me  to finish my sketch rather hastily. I then passed off hastily until I had eluded the noisy crowd of  ignorammus's and by permission getting upon the  roof of a house. I sketched therefrom the beautiful  and very extensive Sanctuary of \"San Francisco\" as in  fig 28. showing its domes, cupolas, and spires as it appeared from the North east corner. Its bells  are numerous of many tones, and remarkably fine; the  interior like an immense museum, is crowded, with  wealth, and splendours beyond description. It has  as near as I can judge over, one thousand apartments,   a part of which are very elegant in their styles, guildings,  statues, paintings, stuccoed works, altars, tombs, vaults,  organs, galleries, painted domes, stained glass, chandeliers, massive gilt gothic works &c. &c. It covers a large  square, and is almost a royal city of itself. I after proceeded  to the Church and College of St. Josephs, which I  sketched as in No 29. My visits also extended to the magnificent  Sanctuary of St. Domingo, the front of which wasGuarded by a large mounted Cannon, and in a house, beside it several hundred soldiers. The interior of this great  church was the most gorgeous I ever beheld, its walls  and gothic ceiling was so gilt with gold leaf, as to appear  like one immense golden gothic palace. The Captain  of this division politely accompanied me through the  church, explaining its sacred relicts, &c. Among which  I saw immages of Angels, about 4 feet in height appearing to be cast of Gold, encased in splendid cases over  the grand Altar. A similar image of the Virgin  and Saviour sitting upon a throne of very massive  silver clouds, over which was an immense dome  inlaid with porcelain of rich colors. There was A large and  beautiful Organ upon a highly ornamented gallery, resting  upon Lions, that seemed watching the congregation,  And numerous saints in richest robes, (of nearly full  size) were to be seen in every direction. The interior  forum of the church was that of a cross, having two  magnificent Altars. I asked permission to sketch this  fine church from the little plaza front, but was  told that it could not be granted, without a  special permit. I then proceeded to sketch theyards, with numbered cells, in which from 10 to 30 may sleep on a brick pavement, having their own blankets of course. There is usually a cook shop in one of these cells, called a \"Fonda,\" where coffee, meat &c. are prepared to order, and usually well charged for; although the cooking may be very inferior to any thing in the States. In chocolate, however, the Mexicans excel, and sometimes in coffee, and especially in light sweet cakes. March  25th.  (Sunday)  Our company (of between 40 and 50,)  Left San Louis Potosi this morning at half past five, in double file presenting to the gazing crowds quite a military face, as red flannel was very conspicuous on almost every man, for almost every coat was off, it being clear moderately warm, and very dusty for a time. In the distance the city appeared beautiful and interesting. We soon entered upon open and barren rolling hills, where I found several handsome specimens of agate scattered among gravel. I neither heard of, or saw any of the silver mines of this State, though I believe them to exist in Durango, Zacatecas, and the state of San Louis Potosi, as large silver trains pass down to Tampico from this country, every few weeks. [*38A*]about 10 miles from San Louis, we entered upon some very rocky hills, into deep ravines, several narrow vallies and through narrow passes, with a cross here and there at short intervals, marking the spot where some traveller has been murdered, and his remains, if poor, deposited beneath. Our company was composed of over 40 American two Spanish guides, 8 Arrearos' or mule drivers, (Mexican) and 14 pack mules to carry our baggage allowing 150lbs. to each mule in order to travel with speed and safety. Our guns, pistols, swords, knives, &c. were all ready for immediate use, and were kept in excellent order, and many of our boys made the vallies echo with their jovial songs whilst passing, at the same time keeping an eye for any vagrant Guerrillas among the cliffs and brushes. One of the narrow vallies through which we passed during this day was peculiarly romantic, whilst a broad creek filling nearly the width of this valley of precipices, meandered with it; the bed of this creek, was in most places almost dry, so that we travelled some miles upon beds of gravel. At one place, on passing up the side of a precipitous, volcanic hill, I saw a very great quantity of handsome Geods of Calcedony, scatteredchief plaza looking eastward, including the fountain The Parroquia, a fine church, and a small part of   St Domingo east of it. A crowd of idle male and female spectators soon assembled around me bobbing continually their ugly phiz's directly in my face, so as interrupt, and intercept the view I was sketching -- presently two officers in military uniform, arrested me, and proceedded with me to an Alcalde's office, at the left base of the Governors' Palace. He wished to know  if I had a permit to sketch, I informed him that I had from the Praefectas' Clerk; upon which he discharged me and sent an officer (in uniform) to accompany me to my former seat on the Plaza, who stood by me with drawn sword, and like a gallant man kept men, women, and boys, at full bey, until I had finished my task, when he left me with a polite bow, &c. No 30, represents that sketch on the chief plaza. This plaza is almost always densely crowded by  all grades and classes of people, who stare as much as Americans, as though they were Bedouin Arabs; No 31. is a red sand stone fountain, which I sketched in the Southern port of the city at the head of the Allamo                                           walk before described.It is much of the time crowded by visitors for water, No 32. is the chief market plaza; upon this plaza are numerous Doric pillars, well finished from red sand rock, it is intended in time to place a roof upon them so as to shelter the market to be held therein. This view is looking north, at the present time the markets are held around the principal building. A good cup of coffee can be had here for a Mordeau 6 1/4 ct and mellons with many other things proportionably cheap. At this date 25th March, water mellons &c. are plentiful and cheap; the markets appeared flush with delicious fruits, oranges, mellons, cantelopes, bannannas, &c. etc; but no apples or peaches; no walnuts, chesnuts, or hickory nuts, yet similar though better than the market of Tampico. The scenery about San Louis Potosi is in places romantic and interesting when combined with the distant mountain scenery of the Southwest; the contrast of mud huts with splendid edifices and the superb residences of the wealthy are very striking and is the first thing to be observed by every traveller. At this place, they are decidedly hostile to theAmericans, partly I presume from the late war and in part from religious education. At evening the  Host, or priests, pass around in a fine carriage, drawn by mules; before which a number are seen walking, each carrying his candle, whilst several small bells, are tinkling to the heavy toll of deep tone'd bells of the Sanctuary every person male, female, young & old, must Kneel to  the host whilst passing This is a strict religious  ceremony, the nonobservance of which brings at once  upon the head of the disobedient immediate dangers  either in being stoned, or possibly something worse,  besides inculcating the ill will of the observers. In  San Louis, though there are English, French, and  some Americans, yet they are much more strict  in Religious observances than in Tampico, and  Americans should be more on their guard in  passing into the interior of Mexico and westward. As near as I could ascertain, the population of  San Louis Potosi, is about 75 thousand. The proportion of which are illitterate Mexicans of the Indian  race, called Mexican Indians. They are usually clothed  indifferently, live similar in mud huts, upon mud  floors, andlead a servile life, or one of complete indolence. Our Company remained 3 days in San Louis in order to purchase some fresh Animals, shoe others, and prepare for our further progress to Mazatlan. The two divisions with others joined in order to leave Potosi together, so as to make a display of arms, as we were informed that 70 armed guerrillas had preceeded us to the mountain passes in order to rob us, as it was currently reported here that we were in posession of a large amount of gold, and going to California to remain. It is well known that a large population of robbers live in San Louis Potosi, whose chief business is to watch and rob travellers, which makes robberies every day affairs in this country. The Mexican Indian population of this part of the Republic, seeing the monopolies of the government, have rebelled and endeavored to first down the present government with that pretext, and at the same time committing gross outrages and robberies under that cloak, by themselves. I am not aware of any Hotel in the American style existing in the whole city of San Louis, Masons or public houses exist there, which consists of squarefor at least a half mile upon the pass, No 33. is a hasty sketch taken offhand in passing a part of this interesting valley, having a large gravel bed in the foreground No 34. is a sketch of curious mountain looking west, from the summet of a gently sloping prairie hill, after having ascended from the narrow passes, and large hills on the east to this much more elevated country. In the afternoon we came upon an extensive open prairie with a gentle slope of miles, without timber and covered with parched grass, so that there was no shade, with an abundance of dust flying in considerable clouds. Several times during the day, Mexicans, richly dressed, and well mounted upon firey steeds, would ride into our ranks, bow politely, talk for a time, and then disappear, we judged them to be the guerrilla spies, and took good care to show them our determination and strength of arms. Just before sunset we arrived at the Hacienda of Tepetate, the proprietor being hostile to the Americans, would not permit us to occupy the Mason, so that we were compelled to camp out not withstanding the night proved to be very cold; we raised our camp fires, and soon prepared excellent though plain suppers, which took their usual round in messes. A strict guard was set, and the1849. March. night passed off without molestation, although anticipated before sunset I took sketch No 35 of Tepetate Hacienda. (Monday)  26th  Day clear and warm. Commenced March this morning at 6. O clock. The scenery ahead was extensive, pretty, and interesting. Several of our men were on the  sick list to day, but nothing very serious, except one man who had his arm broken some days back of San Louis Potosi, but he is now rapidly improving. Our journey today extended 18 leagues, the same as yesterday and one horse lost on this days' march, on every day event with the numerous trains on this route to Gaudalaxara. During the day we passed over a hilly country and  then upon a gently rolling country covered with immense fields of wild cactus, prickly pears, and other thorny plants usually from 5 to 10 feet in height, and often extending thus as far as the eye could reach, without any relief of other plants, &c. I found some pretty specimens of Chalcedony by the way. At evening we arrived at the Hacienda of Novelia, about 100 miles from Potosi. A pretty green valley was spread out on the right, and a similar valley to the left, whilst we descended upon the rocky side of the hill as inNo. 36 into the right hand valley facing the southwest, we camped again in front of a Mason, and they were still hostile towards us. At night a cloud dark as Egypt rol'd o'er us from the North West, with a short but heavy shower, accompanied with heavy thunder and lightning. Our baggage escaped by being carried under shelter, and we passed a very uncomfortable night. About eleven at night when darkness reigned in blackness, a noise like stampeeding or stealing  our horses and mules took place. 7 or 8 of our party immediately proceeded to search for the intruders with loaded arms, but found none there except our mule drivers; An hour after some alarm was created by hearing about 40, reports similar to the firing of guns in quick succession over in the next valley; we were however ready for any guerrillas or other intruders, but they did not trouble us further, as we fired salutes a number of times which echoed along the valley like sober precautions. [*Tuesday 27th*] Day clear and warm. Commenced our march at 6. O. clock, and crossed extensive open, dusty, and hot prarie plains. By eight in the morning the Sun generally gets warm and quite hot by nine, which continues until the customary evening breeze springs up from 12 to 5. O. clock.About noon we passed a romantic village where I sketched the church in No 37. but did not think to learn the name of the village as I was much in the rear when I drew it, besides being attacked by a noisy pack of wolfish dogs. To day we began to find plenty of palatable fruit upon the prickley pear plants that were very abundant on our way; which became more ripened as we advanced. We passed around the base of a lofty and barren rocky mountain into a magnificent valley, where could be seen many handsome Haciendos, ranches little lakes walled up, with strong stone breastwork, extensive fields under good cultivation, some of which were irigated by fresh running streams, woodlands, a small meandering river, orange-groves, and other marks of civilization, besides another long and very beautiful village, along a broad and shady road, very unlike what we had seen since leaving San Louis Potosi. It was really an extensive or far reaching valley of civilization handsome ranches, and a garden spot, among the barren praries and mountains of Central Mexico. Rabbits (with long ears and) of uncommon size, were very plentiful, 7 and 8 have been started at a time, of course we made some fine meals from them; A fine fresh breeze blows yet each afternoon from the Gulf of Mexico but in a few more days we are told that it will blow from the Pacific Ocean, towards the east each afternoon at the same time though opposite to that from the Gulf of Mexico. Before Sun set we landed at a rancho called \"San Nicholas\" a dilapidated rancho unlike much of this fine valley which I sketched as in Number 38. here some of our party were in to bathe, though the water was cold, being considerably elevated; water mellons, eggs, &c. were abundant and cheap, and the mellons of excellent quality. Notwithstanding we might here occupy rooms in a  Mason, yet most of our party preferred sleeping out in the open air, although it was somewhat cool at night. At this place there is a small church, which from the peculiarly rude paintings of Deer &c upon it, I would judge to be very ancient among modern things; it has however a flat roof, which is the customary Mexican fashion of building, except where they have become partially Americanized.Wedned. 28th. Day clear and warm. Commenced our march at 6. O. clock for a short days travel of only 15 miles to the beautiful city of San Maria Del Lagos, which is located down the same handsome and fertile valley as before described. Our road was broad, well setled, and abounded with shade, water, and pretty scenery, whilst we were most of the time in full view of the two opposite mountain ranges of barrenness on each side of this pleasant valley of groves and gardens. We entered Lagos city, over a small but handsome stone bridge, by a broad road, quite equal to some of our American McAdamized roads, and of very pretty and romantic scenery. We entered in double file with the pack mules ahead as usual, and presented quite a line of a military face, as each had his coat off, exhibiting uniformly red flannels, and plenty of well kept arms. Multitudes gazed upon us with apparently great surprise and curiosity, to which we have now become accostomed. After winding about for some time along the various streets, &c, we at last came to quarters in the \"Mason De Merce.\" Crowds soon surrounded our wide spreading archway,to sell us mellons, oranges, sweetmeats, etc. &c. In company  with a friend I visited the Market plaza, where I  purchased a fine cantelope for a Quartelia a 3 ct. piece,  a bowl of buttermilk for a Tolacco, 1 1/2 ct. piece. A good  water mellon for a Quartee, 3 cts. a box of excellent  preserves for a Tolacco, 1 cent and a half, and a good  bowl of coffee for a Madeau or 6 1/4 cts. This is the  only place where I ever saw Ice cream for sale. A number of delicious fruits crowded this market, that  we never see in the States, some of which we found  wild along our road. Near the Market there is a  fine large public plaza, well built up with stones  of the first class, with shade trees, many good seats,  and a handsome fountain in the centre. On the North  side of this plaza there stands one among the most  noble and massive Sanctuaries of Mexico, and usually  ranked among her chief churches, which I  endeavored to sketch as in No. 39. it is build of a hard  light red sand stone approaching a cream color; I did  not obtain its dimensions, but it is certainly larger than  any church which I have ever seen in the States, and  in workmanship equal to the finest church of New York.It rises in Lagos like an immense collosal pile, a great monument of perseverance and skill,. It has been erected about 40 years, and towers above the city like St Peters' at Rome. The interior is still more splendid than its exterior, gorgeous displays of wealth, immense gothic works in gold and  silver leaf, are suspended from the far off ceiling, an organ, richly decorated is supported by a beautiful and curiously formed gallery, Pilasters of great height trimmed with silver leaf, rise between and separate very large and brilliant paintings. Statues, here and there decorated with costly dresses, gems, &c occupy their several positions whilst the chief  Altar is a piece of work of great expense and  magnificense, [whilst] and a high arching dome throws its many color'd lights down upon the rich counter colors of the chief Altar, and gives to the whole a peculiarly beautiful appearance. Bells of great magnitude (originally from Spain) toll at various hours of the day in concert with the other church bells of the city. By permission I ascended the only tower in which the great bells are suspended, andfrom that massive stone cupola, I sketched scene No 40.  looking south west over a portion of that fertile  valley before described, and a part of the city of Lagos,  including several fine churches, and the nunnery &c, showing two important table mountains in the distance, the present bed of the river, which is now nearly dry, and the flat rooves of the city; with a small part of the public plaza. This is the most interesting section for a view out of four, as it comprehends only about 1/4th of the city, and time would not permit me to sketch any others in this interesting city. The delay of a half day at Lagos was occasioned by our horses and mules requiring some improvements in shoeing, thus affording me a short period for sketching. This town includes about 12 thousand inhabitants, and is apparently a thrifty and stirring place of considerable neatness and beauty, though in places antiquated. This afternoon at 2.O.clock, a party of 7 Americans and 5 Frenchmen arrived here from Verra Cruz, and the city of Mexico. They met with troubles and dangers by the way, and were very glad to join in with our company in going to Mazatlan, which a part of them did in dangerous times.[*Thorsd 29th*] Day clear and warm. Commenced our march this morning at 6.O.clock, for the beautiful city of \"San Juan Del Lagos,\" a place of about 7 thousand inhabitants, and about 12 leagues distant from the former. More than half the days march was over a dry and barren country. We approached within a very short distance of the town, before discovering it, as it was  situated in a narrow and very deep valley, and hardly discovered until we had got nearly over it, when we descended a paved road directly into the city of life, and dense crowds of curious spectators. The scenery of this deep and narrow valley, with its meandering  water course, and the distant mountains, was peculiarly  barren and wild; but the town had pleasant orange groves, gardens, &c, with shady walks and fountains here and there and a very handsome plaza, upon which  was the largest and finest Sanctuary we had yet seen even surpassing in magnitude the one last seen,  this was indeed a stupendeous pile of human art and perseverance; a sign informed us that its age exceeded 100, years, and it was yet in an excellent state of preservation. In front of this grand Sanctuary therewas a handsome fountain in the centre of a public plaza, surrounded by seats and in a circle of small Allamo trees. Most of the houses were highly ornamented with various colored devices, whilst rows of massive collonades, made the plaza scene quite agreeable, which was very much crowded by the inhabitants, and the market plaza was in its immediate vicinity. No. 41 is a sketch of the grand Sanctuary of \"San Juan Del Lagos.\" in magnitude and external beauty it exceeds the other at San Maria  Del Lagos, but in its interior magnificense it is about the same though still more expansive. The floor of the interior is inlaid with porcelain of China of various colors of chequered work; and the same upon the outer surface of the great dome. The workmanship of the steeples (which are very high) is considered inferior to none in all Mexico, certainly I never before saw any similar work equal to them, either in Mexico, Canada or the States. Time would scarcely permit a careful sketch of this massive edifice, and night closed upon me without my being able to get others from other positions, of fountains, churches, and a view of the city &c. As our party left early next morning no time of course was available for further sketches.[*Fridy. 30th*] Day clear and warm, Commenced our march at half past six O.clock, crossing a large and costly stone bridge, the handsomest and largest I had yet seen in Mexico; it was handsome and built entirely of a light hard free stone; toll was paid in crossing it. a paved road wound around and up the hill in a serpentine form until it reached the summet, from which there was a splendid view of the town, river, churches, groves, &c; we passed from this pleasant view into another very steep, deep, and narrow valley; from which we arose again to follow a rolling barren country of prarie hills, covered here and there with fragments of loose broken rocks, and much broken chalcedony. An Alcalde with Lady, &c. has accompanied our train for several days, keeping near us, and travelling in a regular Mexican carriage drawn by 6 mules, four of which travel abreast, with a driver sitting upon one of them, the whole affair appeared clumsy. He usually stopped at the same Masons with our company; he was evidently travelling under our  protection from Ladrones or robbers, as the Mail and several Mexican gentlemen were then dooing.about 9.O. clock this morning a body of 3 or 4 hundred Mexican soldiers passed us, followed by many women and children, the whole of whoom were on foot except their officers. At the head of one of their companies was an Irish Deserter who addressed us in the usual language of contempt whilst a number of the soldiers spoke to us in Spanish and a little in the English. They were bound for Rio Verdy, a town of importance towards Tampico, in order to put down Queros and his party, who were opposed to the Government of Herrara. During the after part of this day we passed over an extensive country of open rolling and barren praries, exhibiting scarcely any thing else but rocks, gullies, parched grass and in places an abundance of dust. At evening we landed at an old dilapidated rancho, where provisions were scarce and dear; the name of this rancho was \"Lavent,\" which I sketched and No 42, at sunset. [*Sat. 31st*] Day clear and warm. Commenced our march this morning at half past six O. clock, having only 7 leagues for the day For the first time, we now passed through a valley of gentle undulations, having a very red soil, that  was under cultivation, and appearing to be productive, along the valley there was about a half mile to the right,a high hill appearing very much like an old dilapidated pyramid, which was the opinion of several who saw it. During this mornings march, we passed through several small villages of scattering mud cabins, inhabited as usual by Mexican Indians. About 1.O.clock we descended a paved road into a broad ravine, and after crossing a bridge ascended upon the side of a low spreading hill into the town of Tepatillan, where we remained until the following morning as it was too far to the next rancho for the day. Before night [nigh], I sketched the church as in No. 43. the age of which is nearly a century and a half. It is a plain building, very large, and of an Antiquated appearance. This town contains about 6 thousand inhabitants; having a neat and pleasant appearance about the plaza, and chief streets. The walks of the plaza are all followed by ranges of very large and spreading shade trees resembling the Oak though more expansive. In the centre of this plaza there is a handsome fountain, and on the South Side of it, the town market, and opposite under a long colonade where the Alcalde's office was located. A young man from the States, was arrested [here] by some Frenchmen andimprisoned here on a charge of stealing two hundred  dollars, which he protested against strongly. Most of  our company visited him, and by much taking with  the Alcalde had him taken from a miserable cell  of crowded polution, and placed in better quarters,  we could not get him released, and had to leave him  at the mercy of his enraged enemies, and the Alcalde  believing him to be innocent of that charge, although  he frankly acknowledged having stolen 60 dollars  in Mexico, whilst in distress. Upon which acknowledgement  the Alcalde made out his commitment. The  Frenchmen (we were afterward told.) Said they would  wait until the Americans had left, when by some  means they would get him out, and kill him in the  mountains. The whole appeared like a sad affair. I felt sorry for the young man for we could not  render him assistance without endangering our own  liberty. The feelings of the whole American Company  were against the Frenchmen, who treated him with  severe abuse. He was a delicate young man of about 20.  and said that he had left a widow'd mother and a  sister in the States, and he pointed to a ring on hisfinger, and said that this was the only token of theirs now in his possession, and that at night in his cell, the Mexicans had wrench'd his finger repeatedly to get it. If he escapes, it will be by some miracle unknown to wiley Frenchmen, and stupid Mexicans. This evening the host passed around the plaza drawn in his superb carriage, with the usual ceremonies. April Sund 1st Day clear and warm. Commenced our march at an early hour. The first part of the day we passed over a rolling and barren woodless country, with mountains in the distance. In the afternoon we descended into a lower country a large valley extending many miles and somewhat of a triangular  form as in No 44. In this valley a stream meandered along which in places woodlands appeared. At one place on a low and spreading hill, beside this stream, was located a very romantic and beautiful little town, the admiration of all our company. It appeared to be one forest of very tall orange trees, with bushels beside bushels laying thickly strewn upon the ground in almost every direction with small and neat cabins scattered here and there through these extensive groves. Most of the orange trees  were over 20 feet in height, much resembling largeapple orchards. Among the rest of the pleasant things to be observed here, was a cool and refreshing mountain spring of considerable size rushing rapidly in various branches down the quick descents of several of its streets. Shaded by palms, cactus, orange groves and shrubbery, We passed in sight of the plaza; where I saw a neat looking church. About 4 or 5 miles from this village we passed through another, less shaded, beside the same stream, and near a fair looking stone bridge. Still continuing in this long valley, just before sunset, we came to a river of good size, and descending a long slope lined on either side with Mexican cabins, from a  large mason on the hill, down upon a very large and antiquated stone bridge, upon which were four square towers, upon two of which were statues of the King and Queen of Spain, with an inscription beneath nearly obliterated by time, upon the other two towers were statues of monks or fathers. we crossed this large bridge and put up at a mason on the opposite side in the little town of Tolololotlan, after passing up a street of cabins of more than a mile in length, we found our Mason. I then proceeded in company down to thebeautiful banks of the Rio Grande or San Antonio, and sketched  the great bridge as in No 45, looking north from  above on the west bank of this interesting stream. On the opposite or North side of the bridge of  Tolololotlan, the whole river pitches over large  masses of rocky boulders with a heavy lumbering  roar that can be heard for several miles before  reaching it; above it spreads out to a considerable  width dotted here and there promiscuously with  small and interesting islands, with green meadows  rolling hills, and the lofty blue mountains, all of which  forms a highly picturesque scene, which I endeavored  to sketch as in No 46. On first beholding this fine  little river, it may naturally be supposed that we  rejoiced at the first sight of a stream that emptied  into the great Pacific Ocean, and it seem'd to make  us feel that a part of our great journey to California  via Mexico would soon draw the land chapters  to a grateful close. On the following morning by early light  I sketched a part of the interior of our Mason as in sketch 47.  where the earthen flower jars were plentifully ranged  around the tops of our mason columns, containing  shrubs &c.1849. April. At this place we fell in company with a small New York party  of 8 or 10 persons, and learned from them, that one of  their party had been shot in the head by accident and  killed instantly, it happened at a bridge not far from this  place; the father of the deceased was present in the same company. Mond 2nd Day clear and warm. Commenced our march at 6.O.clock for 8 leagues. Passed through a small cove, and then upon a high plane  where there was a considerable pond or small lake, and  afterwards crossed a deep ravine upon a stone bridge by a  small village, a place noted for robberies &c. and from thence  proceeded over a hilly and picturesque prarie country until  we ascended a considerable ridge, in company with a very  large burthen train of miles for the great city just ahead. On descending this slope into a somewhat lower country  a distant view of Gaudalaxhara, broke upon us as in  sketch 47. which I hastily copied by the way, being then  within about 6 miles of the city and looking North west. Before arriving at Gaudalaxhara, at 4 miles distant, we  passed through a small town of a very pleasant appearance  in which there was the remains of a once superb sanctuary. A handsome shaded plaza with a curious fountain,  and a tall and handsome dragon fountain at the North west  suburbs of the town,on this plaza sweet meats, lemonade, and other  mild drinks with Polka, a drink sweeter than cider, with oranges, mellons, bannannas, and other fruits were very abundant and cheap. the exhibition of which presented quite a pretty appearance as they were promiscuously ranged about the fountain plaza beneath the broad spreading shade trees. From the suburbs of this town to the suburbs of Gaudalaxhora, there is a broad Mc Adamized road 3 miles in length, with 4 rows of spreading shade trees, principally of the Allamo with others of very great magnitude, as in sketch  No 48. extending its whole length, thus dividing two pleasant and shady walks on both sides of the principal road, which was about 50 feet in width, about 100 feet including each walk, this road with its neighboring scenery and a distant inkling of the city presented quite a pretty and interesting appearance. We entered the city in double file, with pack mules in the advance. The suburbs appeared very extensive, and it was at least one hour before we reached our Mason, as we seem'dGaudalaxhara. continually winding hither and thither, among a continuous crowd of strange brown faces and peculiar scenes. Having arrived in one of the handsomest and greatest cities of all Mexico, I hastened to avail myself of every opportunity to explore and discover its fine arts &c. In entering we passed 4 or 5 very handsome public edifices but time would not permit me to sketch them except in a  general view. an aqueduct of water, at first mistaken for a regular canal with stone bridges, abutments and its handsomely finished breast works crosses the southern part of the city proper, along it there are shady walks of trees great Magnitude and age, with fountains in shady places,  and fruit plazas in various directions; watermellons were vastly abundant, and cheap, piles of them were seen on almost every little plaza, where any fruit might be sold. As near as I could ascertain the population of Gaudalaxhara, was about One hundred and seventy five thousand which I believe is about the correct estimate, as it appears much larger than Baltimore, M.D. April. Tuesd 3rd Day warm & clear. Our company concluded to remain in this fine city over this day to proceed early on the morrow. Of course I saw and sketched as much as possible. [*31*]The city is very regularly laid out in right angle streets, usually from 20 to 40 feet in width public gardens and several fine plazas, besides market squares variously. It is considered more than twice as large as San Louis Potosi, and the most beautiful of all the cities of this Republic, and second only to the city of Mexico in size. It is located in an interesting valley, and surrounded by barren mountains in the distance, and elevated several thousand feet above the level of the Ocean. A part of the valley about it is under very good cultivation and presents an extensive and civilized appearance. Every thing combined with a pleasant breezy afternoon, such as we had on entering Gaualaxhara, - a prettier scene could scarcely be found in any of the Northern States of Mexico. It is much admired and spoken of by all travelers who have visited it. Its communications with other towns is conducted entirely by mules, and horses, and all goods carried upon the pack saddles of mules. So that the main roads leading each way from the city, is almost constantly crowded for miles beyond the reach of the eye, with thousands of horsemen, and pack mules, going and returning in large companies.Near this city such scenes are really so animating that it would seem almost incredible were the number at one single view given. Dust is of course very plentiful During this day I visited many parts of the city, the interior of several splendid churches, public buildings, gardens, cemetaries &c. The main plaza, is the most splendid of all that I have yet seen in (all of) Mexico, and said to be handsomer than that of the city of Mexico. It is in the form of a square, followed by Allamo shade trees upon each side, with neat seats, and a handsome fountain in the center. The buildings which surround it are of the first class, and bear much resemblance to all the old Spanish edifices of Spain. The streets which Surround it, for nearly a mile in every direction, exhibit great displays of wealth, fashion, business, and refinement. There is a custom much used here, of covering the pavements with long and massive collonades of one and occasionally two stories in height. Almost every house, building, or edifice, excepting the finest sanctuaries, have the usual flat rooves, and generally a very massive appearance, somewhat similar to Egyptian customs. [*52*]Here strange scenes and strange brown faces, that - densely throng the plazas, markets, groves, [and] fountains, and beneath the long and massive colonnades, makes the American feel at once his absence from home, and his isolated position among the most strange of foreign countries. Strange customs, ceremonies, dress, and modes of living seems to transplanted you at once into another and different world. Go where you will, you are a stranger, and a strange object of gaping curiosity, even to the Soldiers in the Official Pallaces, who would treat you respectfully with small presents of fruits, and politeness, and permit you to intrude on forbidden ground, whilst a common mexican for the same intrusion without a permit, might find a sharp whack upon his callabash the consequence. Among the litterati and official circles of this city there is certainly less hostility to the Americans, than among the illitterate, half Indian, and Servile population, and those on the way back to San Louis Potosi. On the main plaza, there stands an immense Sanctuary of great dimensions and magnificense: It occupies asquare of itself including a grand wing called the Cathedral, as in No. 49. The chief building under the larger dome being called the Sagrario, all of which is now being repaired and repainted with superb interior displays. It is the grand Sanctuary of this city and among its finest buildings for interior displays, which are immensely grand and very elegant; gems, Saints in splendid attire, magnificent Altars, Organs, paintings, large immages apparently cast in gold, over the Altars, inlaid porcelain, work, stained glass of various  colors, beautiful silken draperies, massive silver ornaments, gothic columns, and gothic domes gilt with gold and silver leaf, until the whole glittered by the evening lights like some fabulous golden palace for beings above the common things of mortality. No such scenes of granduer can yet be found in the States, and I have been repeatedly surprised at the enormous wealth, which must have been lavished upon these religious pallaces in Mexico. judging from the time, and immense labor required in their completion; and in their superior pieces of Sculpture, Architecture, and paintings, with their mammoth bells, and [*53*]fine toned Organs, superior castings, elegant designs, drapery, massive granduer, orders of Architecture, and fine materials, which at this day, far exceeds the small and half civilized capacities of the original Mexican inhabitants. From Spain all this display of wealth, &c has originated, been cast, planed, carved, painted, and then transplanted upon the planes, vallies, and mountains of Mexico, and there set up profusely all over the land in immense colosal monuments, whilst Mexico was under that Government. From this beautiful plaza I proceeded towards the aquaduct Southward, where getting upon the flat top of a Mexican Mason or public house, I sketched scene No 50. looking North East, towards some of the mountain ranges, and over the prettiest part of Gaudalaxhara, which I selected from the four views, showing a part of the aquaduct a fine large church, a part of the Hospital in the distance and a fine long park. The principal part of the city rises upon a broad and gentle undulation to the left of this aqueduct, the face of which is dotted here and there with handsomepublic edifices as in this view (No. 50). I then  proceeded to a fine public garden about a mile  from this location, in which I took sketch No. 51. I suppose that it covered about 8 acres, being larger  than any of the squares of Philada. In the centre  of it there was a large fountain, from which fine  walks passed off in each direction. Shade trees  of great magnitude covered the square, whilst the beds were full of beautiful shrubs in full  bloom, which on entering presented to us the appearance of a beautiful shady grove richly and  closely carpeted with many species of flowers  so ingeniously interwoven as to show the  figgure of one large flower by the shades of  those planted together. This I have seen  in many places through Mexico. In this garden  there was a fine large revolving swing with 4 seats,  similar to those in the States. This was a large and  very beautiful garden and appeared to be a place of fashionable  resort. From this place I proceeded towards  the aqueduct and sketched a curious fountain in  the long park as in No. 52. From this fountain [*54*]I proceeded about two miles to the northern suburbs,  and passing several beautiful churches of curious  Architecture, I came to a large enclosed Square, which  proved to be a cemetery; apparently of recent origin.  in the center of this square [was] I sketched No 53.  which is a handsomely ornamented and chequered frame with two interior apportuents which were  beautifully ornamented and richly decorated within  No 54 is a sketch of a beautiful freestone monument in the same enclosure. Directly facing No 53, and at  the opposite end of the same pavement I sketched  the grand collonade building as in No 55. each of those  square chambers along it are intended for two or more  coffins, the door of which being closed has upon the outer side the usual inscription of the tombstone. Day light prevented further sketches , though I would have taken many more if the opportunities would have  permitted. The market plazas were located in  several parts of the city, and were crowded to  excess with watermelons and other fruits. and on  one plaza exceeding any thing I had ever seen in  Mexico, and a most beautiful sight too, as everythingwas very tastefully arranged, even to the different colors of Lemonades, &c. Many fruits were abundant here that are never seen in the States.  most of which are sold at reasonable prices. After leaving the cold winter of the States and comming so suddenly into hot weather, dust, mellons, and oceans of fruit amid a Summer heat in Mexico  you may well suppose that we are quite sensible of this change; whilst we often remarked to each other, that our relatives at home little thought that we were now feasting upon the  finest mellons in the world, whilst the cold winds of winter were whistling around their homes. I doo not think that there are more churches here than in San Louis Potosi, notwithstanding this is so much longer than the former city of Potosi. I visited several fine churches, but had no  time to sketch even a small part of the great beauties I saw during even this one day. Though vehicles of any kind were seldom seen through  the country, yet heavy carriages of a clumsey - [*55*]   appearance for the aristocracy and the Priests were quite plentifull in townThe americans still continue to arrive in this city, 40 more during this day from Mexico. Wed 4th. Day clear and warm. Commenced our march at 6.O. clock. On leaving the city, we passed the walls of an extensive prison, which was being erected of stone, at the North Western suburbs. The road was broad, very much crowded, and almost one continued cloud of dust for many miles out of the city. About four miles on the way we passed a neat little village, with a magnificent Sanctuary or public edifice, therein of enormous dimensions and square walls enclosing some 8 or 10 acres, with very high (18 or 20 feet) iron railing in front which was ornamented and gilt, and ranging a full square between delicate pillars and light arches of stone. Some of our party supposed that it was the Bishop's Palace. About 12 miles from the city we passed a tall gate; it was a high stone gate crossing the road in one arch about 35 feet in height with a large Mason, and a few scattering huts about it. After this our road wound aroud large hills, deep ravines, through several narrow passes, and for the first time in a great distance, among numerous large pines, oak bushes, &c ranging over desolate looking hills.At about 20 miles from Gaudalaxhara, I made a hasty sketch  looking west as in No 56. showing the mountains and a small part of the lower valley country, which is somewhat below  the valley of the city we have just left. This is a celebrated  part of the country for Robberies, and we were even told in Gaudlaxhara, that two hundred, Ladrones or  Robbers had left that city the night before us, on our way  to cut us off at about 30 miles out. We did not however regard it, knowing the veracity of Mexican reports  which generally had some other crafty object in view. At about 22. or 23 miles from the city, we came upon an open prarie of rolling or undulating knolls, a part of which had them been recently burned off, on this black charry and dismal looking place, there stood  a large and high gallows, upon which were suspended  the bodies of three Robber chiefs; they had been suspended  there about 3 weeks, and were ghastly looking objects, bullet holes preforated their dried bodies in many  places which were nearly ready to drop to the earth.  over them was a large painted Sign, as follows -  \"Thus the Law punishes the Robber and the Assassin\". Only a few weeks before we arrived here these men [*56*]were chief actors in some bloody deeds, about this place, until some of the government troops overtook them with the justice they merited. The number of these Robbers are said to have been about 200 strong, committing  constant depridations and murders upon travellers and many of the regular Mexican baggage trains. This scene was to melancholy a picture to sketch, so that I left it for a more fit object and about 3. miles further west, as in sketch No 57. I copied a peculiar mountain and small village, to the right of which our road continued its torturous course. In the afternoon as we descended into a third interesting valley, our mountain scenery became extensive, very lofty, and peculiarly wild, moreso than we had yet seen them. Upon the right and upon the left were seen towering mountains, with immense barren cliffs above cliffs, and their numerous rugged woodless spears rising high in the air like collosal ruins of pyramids of yet untold of magnitude. To the west this great triangular valley tapered to our interesting focus, at the far point of which the sun was setting amid a few light and beautiful clouds.whilst the mountains diminished gradually as they receded in the background, all of which formed quite an intersting and beautiful landscape view though very wild. We then descended a hill into the lower valley, and took quarters for the night in a mason, beside the church on the market plaza of the town of Amattitan, being about 40 miles from Gaudalaxhara. Before dark I ascended a high precipice of rocks east of the market plaza, and sketched No 58. showing the square, the big walled spring facing the market, part of the church, part of the town of Amattitan, with its shade trees, with a part of the valley, and the mountains on the western horizon. Here we found plenty of mellons and other fruits all which were quite cheap. Our company here numbered over fifty. A part of them sat by moonlight under the broad archway of the gate of our mason, until 9. O. clock singing in concert, the national songs of America, some 60 or 70 Mexicans, crowded around them seemingly much delighted. About 9.O. clock a Mexican having stolen a purse, from Mr Hassan, was persued and shot at by him, which scattered the rest in short metre.The Alcalde, called next morning and commeded Mr Hassans' course, by saying that he wished Mr H. had killed the thief; it appears that he was wounded, but got off with the bead purse. We were informed at Gaudalaxhara, that this town was, and had been a celebrated rendezvous for the mountain Robbers. &c. [*Thurs'd. 5th*] Day warm and clear. Left Amattitan by early sun rise, and continued our march North west across the valley, among rolling hills of gentle slopes, having small rancho's here and there at short periods; this days road was peculiarly interesting in its scenery we saw to day many fields of the maguay plant ranging over many gentle hills, and upon some of the few fertile spots along the wild mountains base. They make a mild drink from it called  Polka, also the Ardiente, which is stronger than  whiskey, which I believe is made from the magauy also. About 11.O. clock A.M. we passed through Tekelah a town of some importance, noting perhaps 4000 inhabitants. It had a fine shady plaza, upon which stood a very large and antiquated church. On the plaza, fruit appeared in great abundance, andgoing through their usual ceremonies. fruits were abundant and 18, oranges were  bought here for a Madeau or 6 1/4 cts. Orange groves compose the  chief shade of the town. Several very large springs or rather small creeks, breakout of the hills east of the town square, and meander in rapid streams through several of the streets. The water was of a slightly milky cast, and an unpalatable limestone taste. At night the moon rose full and clear, with an occasional flitting cloud, and a gentle breeze. This night a band of 40 Mexicans, all [each] well armed with muskets, pistols, swords, and knives; - presented themselves in double file at the gate of our Mason, or Hotel; and demanded quarters there for the night. Our landlord believing them to be robbers told us to prepare our arms for service, which we did in a few minutes. The Landlord then told them through their captain, that his apartments were all full, and that they could not have quarters in his Mason, to which their captain answered that they would come in in defiance of him and those within. The gate of the Mason which was very broad, and of one expansive arch; the doors of which being open, the Robbers drew themselves up in a compact body immediately before it on the pavement and street. Our landlord stepping forward told them that they must wait a short time until he could see further about his accomodations. But he immediately passed out by another way from his Mason, in pursuit of the Alcalde of the town, who in a short time came with him to our quarters. The Alcalde enquired of their captain who they were, where from be. They answered that they were government soldiers; He then demanded of their captain, their passport as government soldiers, - but they could show none besides the said company acknowledged having travelled on two days, which by the laws of Mexico, no government troops, are permitted to travel. By their dress superabundance of arms, and statements the Alcalde judged them to be a band of ladrones or Robbers, following us, and not improbable that they were a detachment of a larger body, sent in town as government troops, in order to stop overnight in the walls of our Hotel to take us by surpriseand most probably after stealing our arms, then to attack the town, which is a common occurrence in many parts of Mexico. The Alcalde told us that he believed them to be Robbers. He evidently feared them. He told us to see that our arms were all in order and ready for execution in case we were attacked. Its a matter of course all our men were prompt in self defence, and with our guns, pistols, and knives, in hand and about us, we drew up in order, compactly before the door, facing the Robbers, who stood quietly facing and viewing us as mute as a posse of terrified owls; the Alcalde and our landlord refused them admittance into our Mason, but they would have entered by force had not our company presented a bolder front, headed by Capt Grant, of Philadelphia; who told them that they should not enter, except at the peril of their lives, at the same time every trigger was ready to tell. A moment of suspense, and they decamped in quick step up to the town plaxa, where they were permitted to stay by the authorities. After this the Alcalde came several times to ourquarters, telling us to put on extra guards, which we did, even upon the high walls, in order to stand sentinel over our horses as well as our other property, and persons. The Alcalde told us that there was a probability of either our company or the town being attack'd during the night, and wished us to promise that in case the town was attack'd by them, to assist the citizens and his little military force in putting down the Robbers, which we promised, and on the other hand he told us that if the attack should be directed first towards us, his people should assist us, but that we must not mistake and fire upon a religious procession of the citizens which would pass our Mason about 3 O. clock in the morning. This was an evening long to be remembered from many circumstances. It was a most beautiful moonlight night, and now and then a gentle breeze played fitfully from the beautiful lake of Madalena; My turn among the sentinels came from 12 to 2 O clock in the morning; and my positions around the high walls, and the expansive enclosed yards, was pleasant and romantic during so pleasant a night as this; seeming at times like a dream, that I were facing therounds of some ancient castle and looking down among the  dark shades of the groves around slumbering in silence beneath the full and magic moon. I stood upon the house top, meditating upon the beautiful Lake of Madalena, the mountains, standing off in deep shadows, the many flat rooves, the groves and the rocky cliffs near the town; about 2. O. clock a procession of the citizens took place; proceeding from the church and passed our Mason. It was headed by richly robed priests, who were chanting solemn airs; a full sized wax figure of our Savior, of full size, clothed in mourning with a crown of thorns, representing Him as passing up to Mount Calvary, whilst before Him were carried several hundred candles, with several hundred Mexican ladies following each with candles, accompanied with an excellent band of music, the whole was a peculiar scene. Before day light those Ladrones or Robbers before named had all disappeared, having preceeded us on our road through a formidable mountain and vastly grand ravine country, of deep cavernous valleys, suiting such a class of beings.1849 April 6th bay warm and clear. Commenced our march at  half past six o clock, winding our way around that beautiful and interesting lake of Madalena. Formidable mountains appeared in full view and an immense country of sugar loaf hills, sharp peaks, several hundred of which might be seen at one view from elevated positions, at times we passed over a graded road, upon which considerable pains had been taken, about 10 A.M. we descended into a very deep and curious valley of about two miles in width, passing down which it spread out to higher rolling hills with very deep chasms for water passing around these hills and amongst them variously. About 12  meridian I sketched Scene No 63 which was a large Hacienda, westward appeared very large mountains, between which and the Hacienda one several tortuous ravines, the deepest and most awfully grand that I ever saw, being more like immense caverns than ravines. through which we passed about 15 miles. They are called the \"Baranca's\". a road descends upon the  almost perpendicular face of one of them, which is very tortuous and romantic; as you might see the train quite beneath us.winding their way far down the deep cavernous  valley of the Baranca's; as in No 64. with high and  barren Mountains, sparcely timbered towering far above  these numerous deep Barancas. Passing along these  deep narrow vallies, we crossed several times a rapid  creek of some magnitude, over which in many places  high brown rocky cliffs, and various timbers,  bend gracefully over its romatic and noisy waters. No 65. is a sketch passing down the creek in this valley. No 66. do a short distance north west of the former sketch,   with high frowning bluffs of brown rocks. No 67. is another  passing father down the stream, where the road ascends  and again descends to the creek; after fording which  upon rocks [upon] from which the water was bounding  away rapidly; we ascended upon the opposite side,  where a small race of water descended to a pleasant  little dwelling, about which fine timber, several  species of very high cactus, and underbrush with luxuriant  grass were seen forming a highly picturesque  and romantic view. But our train passed so rapidly  that I was much in the rear with my last sketches,  and had to omit this pretty scene for one whichfollowed shortly after as in sketch no 68 where we came to  the junction of apparently three triangular vallies, or deep passes of the Barancas, and the junction of the two fine streams of fair water. At this place there was a pleasant Rancho over the creek, with little groves of oaks, pines, cactus, Bannannas, and beautiful green meadows. Our train turned round and up the left hand valley. And presently  came to scene as in No 69, very high, barren, and steep mountains of almost no timber, arose high in the air, with slight misty clouds around their summets; upon the side of one of them a road was seen ascending which is a view of a part of a graded road, cut over this great mountain by some foreigners at an immense cost, and in most places blown through the solid rock, and of excellent workmanship. In this little valley there was a mill of some kind in operation with a large horizontal wheel. I was afterwards told for the purpose of washing out the silver ore beneath the road, seen on the mountainside, there is a small and pleasant village, in which there is an abundance of fine fruits and surrounded by extensive green fields, meadows, groves, and fine timbers along the stream that meanders through its valley, that spreads  out to a ---triangular cove, dotted with several pleasant Rancho's, No 70. is a sketch taken on entering this pleasant cove where the village was located. After leaving the village we commenced ascending the mountain road. Time would not permit me to sketch as much as I desired, No 71. shows the workmanship on our fine road over, one of the most formidable mountains in Mexico, it is cut out of the rocks, and walled paved and graded thus all the way up this mountain for a distance of six miles. and as great a piece of work of its kind, as any that I know of in the U States of America. No 72. is another sketch farther up this fine road. The view from the Summet of this mountain looking eastward was fine indeed; including many a green and beautiful valley and more mountains, peaks, knolls, hills, vallies, dales, coves, and verdant spots, blended with wildness and prarie hills, than I had ever yet seen in all Mexico; and was really grand beyond description. The mountains far east about Gaudalaxhara could be seen like smoky shadows of deep blue mist. It is said that we have ascended to day, more than  7000 feet, above the deep Barancas through whichwe have just passed; and still a peak arises to our right, around which we wound our tortuous way looking over walls, that looked straight down upon abyss's that were quite beneath us thousands of feet. I found enough here for days of sketching, over which we passed rapidly as it was a region said to be well filled with Robbers, and frequent to many scenes of bloodshed, robbery, and other vile deeds; a few desperate men in these wild mountain passes could doo much harm even to a  large party. On the summit there is a rude breastwork evidently thrown up for that purpose. Cliffs of huge brown rocks here hang over frightful debths and thousands of deep ravines cut deep into and down the rugged mountain. This is our highest elevation  in crossing Mexico, we have gradually ascended 7000 feet to the Barancas, and about 7000 feet again to the summet of this grand dividing ridge of Mexico, making in all an elevation of about 14000 feet above the levil of the Sea. Upon this height we now have the afternoon winds from the Pacific Ocean; and from this forward to the Pacific each day, blowing uniformly from the west, and sometimes very strongly.We now commence our gradual descent toward the Pacific Ocean, an event of some interest to us of course; leaving the scenes east of the great Cordilleres, for those descending gradually into the mild and fertile vallies on the  great western side of this distinguished mountain. No 73. is a sketch of the first scene descending into  a beautiful and fertile valley, along which are plenty of Ranchos, several small villages, several sugar  mills, fine farms, meadows, groves, and plenty of small Mexican dwellings, shaded by Bannanas, Plantains, or perhaps the Allamo, or at times the spreading oak. A pleasant stream of water meandered along this  valley, the margin of which was thickly interwoven with brushwood, wildflowers, and followed by pleasant green meadows, which contrasted in a striking manner with the shadeless, and wild barren mountains; that were broken and rudely tossed into the high air as the fierce storms would toss the waters of the mighty ocean; and as rudely wild, and void of vegetation or timber in many places. This day we have made a march of 54 miles, and arrived at our Mason in the town of [Eastlan ?] a hour after sun set. It appeared to be a fine largetown; at sun set I sketched Eastlan at a distance of a few miles to the  east, being in advance of a part of our train, which during this day got much scattered on the way. There was a fine large Church in this town, with a large shaded plaza or public square, upon which there was a grand display of many  kinds of fruits, drinks &c. including watermellons, Oranges, Bannanas, &c. &c. with Lemonade; Polka, etc. A grand procession of the virgin Mary took place, this evening parading in large crowds the various streets of the town with hundreds of Ladies and Gentlemen each in procession, carrying their separate candles. The immage of the Virgin, was of full size, richly dressed in dark silks, and carried in a handsome Sedan; Other processions took place during  the evening; but I did not see all of them. This is a beautiful town of several thousand inhabitants; the houses are improving, are much neater, larger, and the people becoming much more refined and civilized than many of those before passed; Western Mexico, is well known to be the most refined and civilized portion of that country. We were much pleased with the decided improvement of whitewashing and other displays of taste in this place.No 74. is a hasty sketch of Eastlan and its surrounding mountains. The valley in which it is situated, descends gradually westward towards the Pacific Ocean; and is under good cultivation with pleasant Ranchos', several small villages &c. [*April 7th*] Day warm and clear; with an afternoon breeze from the  Pacific. Commenced our march at sun rise; and proceeded along the meanderings of a pleasant creek; that traversed this interesting valley. A few miles west of Eastlan we passed through a town of considerable size, within which there was a handsome shaded plaza, with a large, curious, and antiquated church. This town was also much shaded by Bannana and Orange groves and a greater part of the houses were very genteel. Here some of our company obtained excellent cups of chocolate &c. Many kinds of fruit were likewise abundant in this place. By the way, as we have before frequently seen, were erected several small shrines of some 8 or 10 feet square, in each of which was suspended the  cross, and around which were wreaths of roses, natural and artificial, with candles partly burned, and other things belonging to their religious ceremonies. These with lone cross's are to be seen plentifully throughoutMexico, and either mark a place of worship, or the spot where some individual has [been] met with an untimely  end. Proceeding down this pleasant valley and winding around various spurs of the wild mountains, that  rear'd their rugged heads upon either side of us, we at 15 miles from Eastlan opened upon a view as in No. 75, with the appearance of a volcano to the right hand. The creek that before travelled rapidly a rocky bed, now joined with other water courses in passing through a ravine or narrow channel of great debth. We now passed over immense fields of wildest volcanic rocks that at some period had been partly fused, and thrown up in rugged masses exceeding any description; extending thus for many miles west and North. The appearance of the rocks was quite black; in places quite spongy, and resembling somewhat the heavy spray of a wild Ocean storm, thrown up in massive peaks, and pinacles, that were at  once suddenly petrified or cooled into black rocky masses of half fused granite &c. Such a field of forrest peaks and black [Schorae ?], I have never before witnessed. The government of Mexico, have cut and paved a road through this lava country at great expense, labor and time.The particulars of which they have taken care to place  upon a pedestial by the way side; whereas by passing the road (such as it was) around a few miles to the left  they might have avoided the worst peaks and ridges  of the [Schorae ?]. Some scrubb oaks high pentangular cactus,  Etc shaded the Lava road in places, until we came out upon  barren hills. No 76 shows a hasty sketch of a part of the  lava fields on our way, looking back Southeast. About  this valley, which have spread out to many miles,  many little Ranchos and villages were to be seen upon  the fertile spots, like favored places upon the  desert of Arabia. The mountains around were exceedingly  wild, and only a few of them even sparsely timbered by a  dwarfish growth, of scrubb oaks, pines, and wild cactus. This broad triangular cove or great valley, was traversed  in every direction by hills, between which were small and  fertile coves, passes, and ravines, along which only the villages  and Ranchos were located. During this afternoon we passed through several pretty villages, that were snugly hid  away in these little vallies, and after passing over   a number of rolling hills, we ascended a mountain  to the north, where we encamped at Rancho Ocott.a few hundred yards from this rancho I sketched scene No 77. looking back Southward upon that great valley of vallies, over which we had just passed; from a height of about two thousand feet. I then passed on up the road 2 miles with a friend, and from a height looking into a vast ravine of perhaps 8 or 10 hundred feet, I sketched scene No 78. looking South west. Showing two great mountains rising in a part of the valley before named; a large stream of water was leaping and bounding off from cliff to cliff down this immense ravine, the sound of which could be heard a considerable distance; whilst it was closely shaded by tall timbers, that rose up the steep sides of the abyss, near to its summet edge. During this day we have seen back in the valley several fine falls of water from 5 to 60 or 70 feet, very suitable for mills but not improved. Along this deep ravine there are fine locations for such purposes. From this place Northward the timber for many miles became very large and plentiful; with large Oaks and pines in particular. During this afternoon Mr Slaight and Mr Jones two of our company were misled upon the wrong track, which caused some fears as to their safety, but both came into camp just  before dark.It is highly important that companies should keep compact whilst crossing the Mountains of Mexico, as those who stray off, are liable to be cut off by those who constantly watch such opportunities in the  trail of the large parties who may cross their country  April 8th  Day warm and clear. During this night individuals well known, left our camp by night, and proceeded forward at full speed, 16 leagues to Tepec, in advance of our train, in order to Secure passage up to california for themselves exclusive of our company should there not be room for all. This was showing their nature horns and all, for which they afterwards doubtless sorely repented, as certain of them had before promised to remain by each other through to California. The remainder of our company proceeded as usual not at all pleased with the rush for passage, almost every Mexican  returning; when asked, gave us different reports about the chances of passenger from San Blass up to San Francisco; and we could ascertain nothing very definite and but little that was encouraging. Some telling us that there was but one vessel in port which could take but four or five more passengers and prices very high, with poor accommodations; others,that there were several vessels in port, and others that there were none that could carry more passengers, and thus the reports varied, but the remainder of us thought best to take things coolly and as they might come; which afterwards proved to be to our especial advantage at Mazatlan. Proceeding northward on the Summet of the mountain on  which we had just encamped, we passed through much large and valuable oak timber. During the morning, I  sketched No 79. which includes Norelio Mountain, as seen  at the distance of about 10 miles to the northward, being also within full view of the town of Tepec to which we were bound. About an hour after sketching the former, we commenced descending a graded road down the mountain,  a part of which I sketched as in No 80. after which we  crossed a fine creek, then passed over and around a number of wild hills with but few scattering habitations, and those of the poorest kind until we came out upon the open woodless hills, that were beautifully rounded and moulded as by art, and only covered by parched prairie grass, and  ranging thus at random around the base of the great Novelio Mountain, whilst sloping off gently in an extensive valley, which was walled in on the North, East, and South by formidable mountains.Again, we ascended a small ridge, which soon gave us a fine view of the great valley of Tepec. We continued descending for Some time upon rolling hills, very sparcely timber with here and there patches of Scrubb oaks, cactus, etc. within about 6 miles of Tepec. I took sketch No. 81. [showing] showing the appearance of the country around that beautiful town. And before entering the town within about a mile and a half I took sketch No 82. showing a fine Stonebridge plastered, and of neat construction; on the principal road to Tepec. This road is generally broad, though not agreeable for [?] vehicles of any kind and is likewise well supplied with fine dust, which during (this) the dry season is almost intolerable during a windy afternoon. Our company arrived in Tepec at 3.O. clock. P.M. a band of dusty travellers, with long beards, jaded, and all the usual et ceteras that attend such a long journey and more especially in Mexico, but not yet closing our journey through this peculiar country. On arriving we ascertained that those preceding us to Tepec had engaged passage up to San Francisco upon a schooner of about 30 tons, that was said to be unfit for service. They paying 70 dollars, and find themselvesbesides being compelled to sleep upon deck; and even at that thinking themselves lucky in getting the chance, at the same time chuckling at us, whoom they considered unfortunate; in not having a chance to sail from San Blass, and at the same time telling us that they pittied us, as we must evidently remain somewheres in Mexico possibly for months to come. But believing that from the greater importance of Mazatlan as a sea port, and place of business, we concluded after resting a day in Tepec to proceed thither, although it was yet another week's journey, the result of which will be seen greatly to our advantage. April 9th  Day warm and clear. In company with a friend (Mr. Sayre), I proceeded this morning at an early hour, several miles out of town upon the summet of a neighboring mountain; (it being a day rest for our animals &c) from the heights of which, an extensive and most beautiful view opened in every direction To the east we saw the lofty peaks of Novelio mountain, and very many of those pretty woodless, and grass covered egg shaped hills before mentioned. Far beyond which formidable mountains reared their misty shadows in dim outline high upon the horizon, upon which the morning's sun had already arissen in his glory amid flitting clouds. The South, thesome great chain of mountains ranged with their many lofty peaks; South west a beautiful valley continued for miles,  with a high mountain ranging west of it. The same mountain  approaching to within a mile of our peak, fell off abruptly  and a valley turned around at right angles with the  former, ranging off into red hills, towards the Pacific Ocean. An extensive and magnificent view broke upon us from  the North, which I endeavored to sketch as in No. 83. North East were seen mountains and peaks piled upon  mountains, many of which were seen far above the mists  and detached clouds of the morning. Here the country  descends rapidly upon the Pacific plains, which are  nearly two days journey from Tepec. The plains could  be seen far on the dim horizon but not the Ocean. This scene was extensive and grand beyond description. To the north and several hundred feet below us, there was  a circular lake of water, No. 84. partly covered with  green rushes, and edged by high walls of rocks, being rugged  bluffs of dark brown rocks, in places covered with a red soil. This lake was nearly round, and elevated several  hundred feet above the valley of Tepec, and exhibited  all the signs of having been at some period a vastcrater to this volcanic country, but now filled up  with water. We then descended into a deep ravine, at the  foot of the hill (letter A) No 84. Through which a fine large stream  water descended rapidly upon a rocky bed. Near the foot  of hill A. is located an extensive cotton factory belonging to Mess  Forbes & Co. as in sketch No 85 .and sketch No 86. taking  two different views of this handsome establishment. The proprietors I believe are Englishmen. Their garden  of Bannanas, Plantains, Oranges and other tropical fruits, is extensive, and exceedingly beautiful, and  more to the idea of some Hindoo scene than one in Mexico. The whole scenery about this factory is  pretty, tasty and romantic. This establishment does  an extensive business. We returned to town by 2.O. clock P.M. after which I sketched the interior of our  Mason (No 87.) or public house, which was tastefull constructed;  our quarters however were not as agreeable as the  appearance of the place. The church on the plaza was large  but of an ordinary appearance, and another similar one  in the town, but a very handsome one of smaller dimensions  1 1/2 miles from the plaza, which time would not  permit me to sketch, and attend to other duties.A hasty sketch of the plaza was also taken as in No 88. It was surrounded by large shade trees of the oak; and in the centre of it there was a pretty fountain of a plain but neat appearance. The plaza was almost entirely surrounded by colonade rows of usually two Story Stores of the first class. The streets of the town ran uniformly at right angles; were clean, and well paved; the same at Gaudalaxhara, the towns of Logos, and San Louis Potosi, etc. The rooves of the houses were uniformly flat, generally one story in height, frequently whitewashed, or neatly ornamented with various colors. But the suburbs of the town, as usual for Mexico, was surrounded by small mud cabins which so much destroys the good effects of Scenery about the Mexican towns, villages, Rancho's etc. At Tepec, we met another American party, and here also 10 of our company left us in order to proceed a distance of 60 miles to San Blass, and from thence embark upon a vessel they had never seen, which afterwards proved to be unseaworthy and landed them some 9 or 10 days afterwards at Mazatlan in (distress and other) difficultiesWe had remonstrated with them however at Tepec, and there they considered their chances much superior to ours. [*April 10th*]  Day warm and clear. Left Tepec at an early hour, and proceeded through a northwest pass, among red hills, little coves, and small narrow and fertile vallies among Shady groves, palms, Bannanas, Plantains, Oranges, &c. and when plenty of watermellons could be  obtained very cheap with other fruits, this region of the country appeared well setled with neat and Shady Ranches, and well supplied with running streams of water. Many farms here appeared like little paradis's for shade romance, and the comforts of life; and many were the  varied scenes of this [day] morning that were really captivating. [except] But in the after part of the day upon the planes, having descended upon a warmer country, we were  open more to the sun, and much annoyed by dust. In making our grand descent upon the plains, we passed down over a long rotine of rugged hills, that gradually diminished as we descended, being sparcely covered with large Palm trees, some underbrush, and now and then parched, prarie grass not of much interest. The view however on descending was extensive, as in sketch No 89.Having descended upon the Pacific Plains, we were  again in a much warmer climate. We again passed from the dull monotony of timbers upon the mountains when such may be found, to a lower country where a large variety were daily presented to our notice. We now saw Palms in great abundance, large oaks, the Banyan, Beach, some cedar, large cotton bearing trees, tropical fruit trees plentifully, with many whose species were unknown to us. We passed several small villages on the planes, and a number of Ranchos. Enormous trees of a species with which I am not familiar, but resembling the mulberry somewhat in shape  and leaf, and in other respects the Beach tree, grows by the road side in many places, and being dense for spreading and of very great magnitude, it frequently gave us an acceptable shade; during our travels across the planes. These five large shade trees, are however not too abundant, and by seeing them in the distance I frequently judged our distance from a Rancho; as they are favorite trees on these planes. This afternoon we crossed two almost dry beds of wheat when flush were called rivers, but not of great magnitudeOn this days route fruits, Mellons, etc, were plentiful and cheap. 16 Bannanas for 6 1/4 cts or a Madeau, A fair water mellon for a Madeau (6 1/4 cts) 1 madeau for a dish of beans stew'd with some meat. 1 madeau for 3 boiled eggs, and 1 madeau for 4 or 6 tortelias or corn cakes; As we had found it on the other side of the Cordilleres, we also experienced here; high prices in Scarce and barren places, and cheap things where the soil was good, well settled, and fruit groves, etc, consequently to be found. About 3 O. clock P.M. our train halted for the night at a Rancho 33 miles N west of Tepec which I sketched as in No 90. The water of a neighboring creek being warm, a part of our company were in to bathe. During this night Mr Davis (who joined us some days back) was scalded by the accidental overturning of our large camp kettle, in which was stewing a fine mess of chicken, supposed to have been done by wolves, that were heard about just before I was on duty as one of the Sentinels from 12 to 2 and several times, heard the wolves, Mr D was not badly scalded however. [*April 11th*]  Day clear and hot. Commenced our march at an early hour, and soon forded a broad and very rocky creek, and during the morning passed through several acceptable woodland groves.Passed a number of ranchos where fruits &c. were plenty and cheap; and the country now generally quite levil. About noon, we came upon the broad sandy beach of a river. Our saddles, baggage, &c. was conveyed across in small boats, (canoes) whilst the whole drove of our animals swam the river together. The scene was  interesting and having a few moments (after just finishing a fine large water mellon) I sat down and  sketched the river, Mountains, &c., as in View No 91. The mountains were still in view; and follow upon our right, all the way to Mazatlan, as we are now persuing our way up the coast, though not yet in Sight of the Pacific Ocean. This river which we have just now crossed (I was told) is called the \"Rio San Diago\", being about 18 Mexican leagues from Tepec, or something over 50 miles. Having crossed the River, whilst the mules was reloading &c. for our further progress, most of our company went into a town nearby (of some size) and refreshed themselves upon fruits, coffee, chocolate, eggs, &c. etc. The town though of good size, was dilapidated and of an ordinary appearance, though commanding apretty location. Persuing our course over a very dusty road that wound hither and thither upon a levil country of brushwood and larger clusters of timber, we passed through a village of perhaps 40 or more houses, all entirely deserted, except one, which was tennanted by one Solitary man of a fierce countenance, being a cripple, who had only a few poor mellons for sale at high rates. This was rather strange yet strangely true, one man the Sole lord of a desolate village, no other Mexican was seen in the whole place, and all was closed up without Signs of furniture; the place may have fell into the hands of Robbers, or be unhealthy; we did not ask respecting it of the man, although it excited remarks in our company. This afternoon afforded but little of interest except some large cotton fields, with ripe cotton, belonging to some Ranchos, and surrounded by fences, which is an uncommon thing in this country, fences are very  rare throughout all Mexico. we travelled many hundred miles without even seeing a fence; although there may be many farms, it is not every man that has a fence, and even those who posess them mostly have very short appologies for fences, which  are rare things in Mexico,I mean fences of wood stone fences of great length, have been seen almost every day or two, amongst the settled parts of the mountains. To day we saw, as beforementioned, fine fields of cotton; but for the first time that I remember in Mexico. We also saw a wild tree about the size and shape of an ordinary apple tree, bearing large and numerous pods of the fine white cotton; And a number of curious fruit trees about the woodlands and water courses. Much of this days travels, all things considered is not by any means inviting to travellers; being dusty in places open to the hot sun, and much of the time rather uncivilized in appearance, which however is no criterion to judge western Mexico by. Before sunset we halted, after a long days march at the Rancho of \"Buena Vista\" being about 145 miles from Mazatlan. I sketched this place as in No 92. A friend Mr Custer, and I went out afar the creak near by for game, and we returned in about 15 minutes with 3 large Pheasants upon which we made a fine supper, and obtained plenty more for our breakfast, and to carry with us for our dinner, our company numbering at this time between 25 and 30. Since leaving Tepec, those for San Blass taking  another road.[*April Thorsd 12th*] Left our Rancho at an early hour. Day clear and hot; with the usual afternoon winds from the Pacific. Passed over an extensive palm country this day, gentle slopes all day covered sparcely with tall and scattered Palm trees, grass burnt off for miles in places; much wild game by the way, few habitations, and those generally of the lowest class. In the morning sketched No 93. of the lofty peaks &c. of the  Cordilleres on our night, which are always in full view in passing up the coast . About noon we again came  to the bank of another River which was partly dry, and at this season fordable, I did not ask its name, but the town of Cauponetta , was on the opposite side to which we forded. A number of Mexican women were along the margin of this river at their customary employment of  washing out clothing; one very clear trait of the Mexicans. Sketch No 94. shows, the river, town, and mountain scenery from opposite Cauponette Puebla. After refreshing  ourselves upon mellons, fruit, etc, in this pleasant town we proceeded forward at a rapid gait to finish a long days march. Much of our road was very dusty, though there was less wind than usual; our country slightly rolling and upon the night a full view of the lofty mountains of the coast.This night we encamped at a desolate Rancho a few miles beyond a river, where things had a distressing appearance we could neither obtain water or food of any importance at this place, so that most of us had neither supper nor breakfast. The appearance of everything about these few huts, was perfectly squallid, and the natives almost totally unclothed and appearing reckless and unconcerned about any thing. We camped beside the road, and huts, and kept strict watch during the night; but a few miles back, on the other side of the river we could have encamped at a small village, where all the conveniences were at hand, but being only a few days from Mazatlan, our company became very anxious to finish their land travels in Mexico, and consequently pressed each day. We missed it, decidedly in crossing the river this night, as we left a pleasant camp grove and conveniences at that place, for a desolate place where we lost two meals, and had no water either for our animals or ourselves  April 13th  Day warm and clear with a fine seabreeze this afternoon Passed through a nearly level country, covered with scattering palms; we came to a village of a squallid appearance about 10. O.clock A.M. where by much trouble we made out to get something to  eat.of all squallid places we had yet seen, this village was the climax. Here in front of a cabin, sat a wretched looking woman clothed in rags, and her feet projecting on the walk from a heavy pair of wooden stocks, where she was fastened probably for some offence. The whole of the inhabitants were almost entirely unclothed and appeared to be living in misery and starvation. Having the bold mountains on our right which were all day in full view, we proceeded onward up the coast through Palm forrests, that seem'd never ending, and towards noon oppressively hot; several crosses were passed this day; whilst this section of the country appeared very much uncivilized; and we frequently met men, entirely without clothing. A range of mountains seem'd now to range off west to the Pacific Ocean, over which it appeared that we must pass, on the morrow; approaching within a few miles of their wild and rugged base, we encamped at a Rancho called Cerauso, as in Sketch No 95. here things appeared more genteel than on the previous night and we were enabled to purchase a scanty allowance of provisions, which were in demand and highly acceptable.April 14th Day clear and hot, Left our rancho at an early hour, and proceeded along the base of rugged mountains directly west to within some 5 or 6 miles of the Pacific beach, but not in sight of the ocean, as we came upon a low ground, we passed around the end of those mountains, and travelled over flat planes covered with high grass, and in places pools of Salt water, and yet on this day we did not see the ocean, although at one time we were said to be quite near to the beach. from the edge of a Small Salt lake, I sketched some large and high rocks, which were the terminus of the mountains and nearest to the ocean as in No. 96. I had no time to ascend it, or I may have possibly first beheld the Pacific from its Summet. Again we appeared to direct our course inward from the coast, which brought us in the afternoon to a broad river, with wide beaches of sand and gravel. This stream we forded and entered the pleasant town of Rosario as in sketch No. 97. The location of this town with its mountain scenery was very pretty and interesting. Fruits of every kind with fine mellons were very abundant and cheap in this place. The churchwas large, antiquated, but of handsome finish; up the river about two miles and upon the opposite side, there appeared in full view a similar building of great magnitude, and from its colors and peculiar structure appearing to be much superior to the building in Rosario. Mountains of great magnitude were from 5 to 10 miles to the eastward. In the afternoon we left this pleasant and populous town, and persuing our way among gently rolling hills Palm groves, and vast tracts of brushy oaks, Bodock trees & we encamped at a village of a genteel but  odd appearance; where provisions were plenty, and cheap, and the inhabitants quite friendly. Oranges, mellons &c plentiful. April. 15th  Day clear and hot, persued our course at an early hour, travelling the same routine of plains, rolling grounds, gullies, Palm forrests, &c this day we passed through many miles of Bodock trees, which much resembled an orchard of civilization, extending, far beyond the reach of the eye, with many thousands of bushels of large Bodock apples; I have no doubt but that in time, the seed of these trees will be sought after  for making hedge fences over countries where timber may be scarce. At noon we passed through a fine large townand stopped for a time to refresh ourselves at the market plazas; immense quantities of watermellons were seen in every direction; Soon a large congregation of Ladies, Gentlemen, and civilized looking people came pouring forth from a  large and antiquated church upon the plaza; and people quietly on their way to their houses, though viewing our company with some little surprise and attention. From this town we persued our way over \"slightly rolling\" country of Palms, oaks, and in places a variety of timbers and encamped at night as usual at a rancho. April. 16th Day clear and hot. Persued our journey at an early hour being in full view of Mountains all day, sometimes among hills, and at others upon plains of Palms or extensive groupes of underbrush, with scattering trees of magnitude. The mountain Scene No 98. was sketched this afternoon, from the summet of a Small hill. during the day we passed over several open praries and at night encamped at a rancho of a respectabe appearance beside a fine stream of good water. April 17th Day clear and hot. Persued our journey at Sunrise in order to reach Mazatlan this day. During themorning our road wound considerably amongst small hills, and was sparcely timbered with some Palms, Oaks, &c during the whole day, except where Salt lakes had left level planes of Sand, with not even vegetation Sometimes for miles in some directions upon one of these sand beds, I witnessed to day, what is called mirage, or the deception of water, ahead. For some time I supposed that we were coming to the margin of a lake whose waters were troubled into waves by wind, but on approaching the same, I discovered the mistake; by discovering that the heat of the Sun caused a mist to arise from the sand, which by its position and  reflection to the eye caused the deception called mirage. about noon we arrived in the old village of Mazatlan distant from the present Sea port of Mazatlan, about 24  miles. At present it is a place no importance, and is much dilapidated; we obtained some fruit here and proceeded on our journey to the port of Mazatlan, before leaving this place I sketched the ruins of an ancient church at one corner of the old village Square as in Sketch No 99. Shortly after leaving this place we forded a river, and persued our course over a level ground towards the Pacific OceanSketch No 100. was taken 15 miles from the Port of Mazatlan. Those hills on its back ground are along the Pacific, and several of them stand out in the Ocean. The foreground is a Sandy plain, on which at w, I thought I saw the lake of water, which as I was very thirsty at the time, appeared quite acceptable, and after taking the sketch, I dashed away full speed with my horse, to reach it with the company, but it proved to be a very complete deception of water. Approaching within 8 miles of the Pacific, we came to the bank of a Salt lake, which I sketched as in No 101. showing the distant hills near the port of Mazatlan. At 6 miles I took another sketch as in No 102. whilst we were passing around the Salt lake. The fresh breeze was fanning us from the pacific; the declining Sun was shedding his gentler evening rays upon us from over the hills of the Port of Mazatlan, as we wound our way around that pretty lake before named, and crossing the flats, we arising suddenly upon a high ground came at once in full view of the long sought for port of Mazatlan, and for the first time a broad and beautiful view of the Pacific Ocean, its islands, shipping, and its foaming  surfs that chased each other rapidly upon the pretty beach before us. What a captivating view; two great objects at one view, the Pacific, and the port of Mazatlan  with also the gratification of now closing our land,  journey across Mexico, and again embarking upon the  mighty waters of the Ocean; and thus ending the second great chapter after leaving Philadelphia, and about to  enter now upon a third important change. All  the past toils were passed over without a murmur, when arriving here, none would of course return by the same way should such ever offer, but none were sorry that they had encountered the toils and fatigues of this journey when they knew it had now closed by land, and was about to commence by Sea; and all were of course well pleased and quite merry on entering the town with their prospects of soon being at Sea; and done with Mexico."

    "paragraph": "Having been some time impressed with the belief that a trip to California would be beneficial not only in a pecuniary point of view, but likewise to the better regulation of health and future happenings, I resolved about the 1st of January of 1849 to have my profession that of a Mathematical Instrument Maker and the eve to be remembered Monumental city of Baltimore for a trip to the golden shores of the far western El Dorado. Circumstances favoring, I made preparations in Philadelphia presuming that my trip thither would be made by sea around Cape Horn a distance of 7000 miles in the Ship \"Mason\" which advertised to leave that port several times fixing definite days of departure. Mr W.H. Ogden called upon me requesting my naming in forming a company then to be limited to 10 or 15 select gentlemen. I consented and gave my name as one of the party them numbering three, whose names were W. H. Ogden, B Jay Antrim and W Middleton, the latter of whom had since resigned and remained at his residence in New Jersey. Mr Ogden and myself drew up a notice at Mr Bonsals' Book Store, at No 33 1/2 Market Street, Philadelphia and inserted the same in the \"Ledger,\" and \"North American.\" The advertisment requesting all desirous of making a speedy and an agreeable journey via Matamoras, Monterey, Saltileo, Durango and Mazatlan to California to address \"Camargo,\" at the office's of those two respective papers, which was soon followed by a number of applicants; who were severally visited by Mr Ogden and myself. Mr Jones, of 6th Street, being the first of that number added to our list. We soon procured a room for meeting at No 100 Chestnut Street through the kindness Majors Collins and Ross, where we met in harmony and concert of action until we had completed our company and extended the number of the same to Forty. At one of the Meetings, the name of \"Camargo Company\" was adopted, which is the name of a Mexican town, to which we were first destined from Philadelphia, by sea, and from thence after having procured there our outfit of mules provissions & to proceed overland to Mazatlan via the abovementioned route. Old resolutions adopted in our \"Camargo\" meetings limiting our numbers were several times rescinded and new ones were adopted until our number had increased to forty as before mentioned & Committees of Camp Equipage, provissions, pasports, protections, for chartering a vessel &c all of whoom acted and reported accordingly. Having ascertained that the abovenamed route was infested with hoards of warlike and savage Camanchee Indians, who were committing outrages and massacring those found in their way, and that the same route was in consequence very dangerous, and believing it rash, as also influenced by friends, I withdrew my name from that route, and proposed the Tampico route to the company as the safest, most pleasant, and a shorter land distance than the former; which then being unfavorably received, I withdrew by advice, and my own impressions of that course, and then prepared to proceed around by Cape Horn. In the mien time, the company adopted the Tampico route via San Louis Potosi &c. and —Mr. Ogden called upon me to inform me of it and his desire with many of my old friends was that I should return to the company: and as they had changed the rout to the one I thought most prefferable, I again added my name. Mr Ogden was elected President and myself Secretary of the \"Camargo Company,\" and in my leaving Mr W Robinson, merchant, was elected to supply my place, in which by request and his absence I served several times after my return. A committee appointed chartered the Brig \"Thomas Walters,\" to convey our company of forty to Tampico in Mexico, which was contracted for at $50.00 each, for cabin passage, and the vessel advertised to sail at 8 O Clock A.M. on the 31st of January 1849. Four members declined going with us and three others filled their vacancies. In consequence of some difficulty in entering our articles at the custom house for Mexico, whereby our Captain and vessel was in danger of the laws of Mexico, - our departure was delayed until 9.0.clock A.M. on the following morning the 1st of February. Feb 1st Slight Snow, cold and finally sleety rain; I repaired with all remains of baggage to the vessel at an early hour, and found many congregated to witness our departure. The crowds along the wharves notwithstanding the inclemency of the weather, continued to increase until many hundreds lined the surrounding piers. A few minutes before 9.0.clock our company repaired with arms to two lines upon the Quarter Deck, and fired from guns and pistols a departing salute. Mr Robinson then presented - \"three cheers to our Country\", which our company responded to with warmth - \"three cheers to the friends and dear bonnie lassies, we leave behind,\" and it burst simultaneously from the very hearts of all. - and \"three cheers to Philadelphia\" which we answered appropriately according with our sentiments of the Quaker City. The citizens upon the wharves responded - \"three cheers for the success of the Carmago Company\" followed by a succession of cheers for individuals named in our company, among which the clerk of the Ship \"Mason,\" observing my singular dress in common with my comrades and knowing me, gave \"three cheers for the Buckskin Injnn.\" and thus did our friends cheer us at the hour of separating from all that was dear to us, to embark upon the great and eventful Ocean of future prospects. About, 9.0.clock A.M. the steamboat \"Wave' came beside and before night towed us in co with another vessel as far as New Castle. At New Castle we dropped anchor for the night, and finding a mistake of six packages of provisions which were nescessary for the completion of the captains' manifest for Mexico, it was found requisite to send Mr Thompson, immediately back to Philadelphia in order to bring on the same by express, which he did by an early hour on the following morning, and received a vote of thanks from the company. This evening was spent with considerable spirit and mirth on the part of Messrs Robinson, C. Jones and Bates; which however was excused by the company in general as they were known to be gentleman, and believed to be unaccustomed to such heavy exercises. Besides the leaving of home under the deepest immaginable of melancholly feelings. This day a vote was taken in the affirmative for prohibiting the smoking of cigars in either cabin of the Brig, the quantity of powder and combustibles on board beeing deem'd a sufficient reason. The Roll was called and the following gentlemen answered to their names, --  to wit. Some of our company went on shore at New Castle and made some few purchases of small articles. Have up anchor at an early hour, and got under way towards the breakwater. weather cold and hazy. Proceeded but a short distance this day and cast anchor 2 miles below Reedy Island, in the afternoon where we remained until 4.0.clock the next morning. Weather clear and cold with a North West wind which drove us out the bay in a beautiful and interesting manner with full canvass on a bounding sea. Personal feelings were consulted over the guard in a member of cases, and after, relief expressed. My feelings were much agitated in consequence of the heavy ocean [swells], and I left an elegant dinner of soup and chickens to contemplate the foamingbillows, and returned when convenient to finish the same, which I did in a few minutes with more relish after having cast over a full account much to the relief of my inexpressible feelings. The dinner table was left patronized by our gents than on the day previous, who were also contemplating the foaming billows with the same inexpressible feelings. One instance of inebriation occurred this day which created unpleasant feelings between the captain and said individual, but was amicably settled to the benefit of said person and any of the company, should they in future indulge, which it is presumed they will not doo, as many if not nearly the whole of them, appear to be temperate and sensible men. This evening being much moderated, with a clear and beautiful Moon, most of our party promenade the whole round of the vessel in rapid Military order, whilst the brig bounded upon the long and high Ocean Swells with that majesty becomming the bread bosom of the Atlantic; whilst the spray threw up to the bowsprit and the sheeted sides, it's showery foam, gilded by the silvery rags of the Moon, and followed in the wake  by a long bright trail of foaming ripples receding in our pathway back to the horizon.Our boat dashed on handsomely to the tune of a brisk wind, whilst the music and merry songs of the happier ones arose in concert with the gently whistling winds that playfully tuned their ocean song amid our rigging and canvass. The whole scene was exceedingly  interesting, and the music harmonious,  being sung by good voices, well timed, and filled with the deepest base voice, for a human being that I ever heard, which added greatly to the sweetness of the music; they sang numerous songs that had more richness amid a scene like this, than I had ever before supposed could be the case; I enjoyed it very much. Harmony and quietness prevail generally throughout the cabins, and no discords have occurred this day. A clear, mild, and beautiful morning. I rose early in order to behold the Sun rise over the ocean, which was beautifully decorated  with long light clouds, which partly shaded its disk and gave more glowing colors to the scene; At 10. A.M. a meeting for worship,was called on the after dark, and Revd Mr. Woods,  officiated, assisted by the Revd Mr Blake, nearly each  member attend the meeting; which was conducted  with very creditible solemnity and attention. The  subject was to those who go down upon the great  deep, with a copy of an address delivered by a Revd  gentleman to the young gentleman of Boston, on emigrating  to California, and the choice of good society. A pistol exploded from firing last night, and Mr. Robinson  was cut back of the right shoulder by a piece  at least 5 inches in length, the would though sore  to stay is not however dangerous. This afternoon  many guns and pistols were fired at the little  dog sharks, that are now following our vessel in  numbers; 7 or 8 of which were caught and hauled  on board with fish hooks and lines; they were  usually two feet in length, and bore some resemblance  to the common pike. This afternoon we have  made but little progress, owing to a calm, and  have hardly average 2 knots an hour for half the day,  Towards night clouds arose with sprinkling rain  and there was a general disposition to be in doors. Monday 5th - Up before sunrise and saw the sparkling ocean spray as our galliant boat drove swiftly o'er mountain waves before a fierce gale which changed to a storm by noon, a day long to be remembered by many of our sea sick company. Such a sight all over the Brig, it only kneeds  an old sea faring man to judge of over 30 green ones just ushered to sea in a fierce gale with rain pelting them like so much fine shot; and they bounding sky high on mountain billows. The bounding of our vessel was truly majestic and far beyond what I had ever before witnessed; all sails were tied up and nothing but the small stay sail open to the gale during the afternoon Nearly the whole company were sick, including myself, but I did not so much as loose one meal by it. I soon had an apetite, which was also  the case with many others; few however were at dinner this day. Upon the whole it was a day of miserable sickening, storm, gales and long billows many of which were full 25 feet in perpendicular height.clouds, rain, howling winds and high sea raged all day Tues 6th Beautiful clear morning, after a terrible night of high winds and high billows. To day the ocean moved in immense swells like small hills, with yawning vallies between, but the morning was clear, and the air mild and further fire unescessary. Our stove being upset this morning we did not rectify it, nor feel the need of it. The sick ones are improving and getting lively; the vessel has bounded on beautifully all day, and we crossed the Gulf Stream this morning, winds from the west which drove us out to sea, possibly 350 miles from land, and this evening a little south of the lattitude of Charleston of South Carolina. Saw one sail to the west this morning. Light clouds in the afternoon, and pleasant moonlight evening, with the sea and winds pretty high. Company merry on deck, & Saw one porpose, 5 or 6 nautilus, and gulf weed this morning all interesting to one looking for a subject. It should have been mentioned that Mr. Hewes, one of our company, lost his belt overboard yesterday containing two hundred and twenty five dollars in gold.Wednesday 7th A cloudy morning, high winds and mountain billows; air cool and winds mostly from the west. We bounded on bravely all this day o'er the foaming sea, realing too and fro, with our deck at times almost at an angle of 45, both side ways and lengthwise. The dishes on the dinner table partook likewise of the general commotion. This whole day was another of swift winds, amounting almost to a gale, which stirred up the billious temperaments of our company as usual, and there were many sick ones about deck again as usual. At 12, at noon, we passed a sail in the distance and at 1.0.clock P.M. another to which we hoisted a red flag with red star upon a square white ground, which they answered with the American flag; the winds and the ocean being  to high to speak them. They were bound to the States. We passed them in about Latitude 32 and about 400 miles out to sea from South Carolina. At night the moon rose amid flying clouds, but the air was so cool, the wind so high, and our deck so much wet by the spray from theangry mountaneous ocean, that few remained on deck long; the berths being prefferable. It is not an uncommon thing to hear one or two fall out of their berths, upon the floor, and to observe a general scrambling of boots, hats, trunks, &c for a downhill race to the opposite sides of the cabin whilst cradling upon the high blue  ribs of the ocean. Then occasionally springing a breeze. Thursd 8th Light clouds, air mild, and a pleasant breeze from the North East, with light ocean waves. Held a meeting on financial arrangements on the Quarterdeck at 10.A.M. Saw a ship ahead this morning bound southward in Latitude 29° 40,\" about 400 miles out to sea. Fine sunny day with bland breezes and very light ocean swells. Nearly all of our company are amusing themselves about decks variously. Catching sea weeds, and fifty other little time killing amusements. At 4 O.clock P.M. we held a meeting on the Quarterdeck during which time we elected Mr. Grant, our Captain, for the trip over Mexico to Mazatlan. Mr. McCrellish, 1st Lieutenant, Mr. Hughes, 2nd do Mr. W. H. Ogden the Quarter Master, and Mr. Thompson, the Commissary. It being understood that we go through during our voyage, a regular Military drilling in order to fit us for cases of insurgency in our Mexican Campaign. A pleasant moonlight evening, air mild, with a brisk breeze, and sailing about 10 Knots the hour. Friday 9th A beautiful morning of pleasant breezes; up early and saw the sun rise clear upon the rolling ocean. We sailed beautifully all day with a fine breeze. Things passed off pleasantly and merrily all day, with a mild and elegant moonlight evening; set up until 11.O.clock, hearing and telling wonderful things, which were magic charms, when told by moonlight on so mild and exquisite evening as this, added the gentle undulations of the sea, the fountains of spray, and the bland Zephyrs of the South. Saw a number of white flying fish during this afternoon, which were beautiful and attractive. Sat 10th A clear, warm, and calm morning, sun even getting hot Near, but not in sight of the West Indies. No wind and almost quiet; Ocean almost quiet; This day proved to be a regular calm, and the sun very warm. Coats and vests off, and hardly a breeze. We do not appear to have moved 15 miles all day. A breeze sprung up in the evening and got us under headway at about 5 knots, with a pleasant late moonlight night. A flying fish came on board this evening and was captured. All are well so far on the vessel. Sund 11th Morning warm, clear, and a brisk wind driving us at the rate of 10 knots towards the island with the \"hole in the wall\", but not in sight yet (11 A.M.) Came in sight of the Bahamia island at 1/2 past 11. A.M. but there being a high head wind, we lost all this afternoon and night in tacking too and from the land, with a high sea. Held a meeting  for worship this afternoon at 1/2 past 3.O.clock. Rev'd Mr. Woods delivered a powerful and highly eloquent appeal to our company, with a good effect. A request was sent to our Chaplain (elect) by several individuals, to their discredit, not to hold services on board; but it being overruled by a large majority, services were held as usual. Monday 12th Mild with high head winds, only about 10 miles gained by tacking the whole day. We were insight of the islands several times during the day. At night a black and angry storm rolled over us with rain and fierce winds raising huge billows, howling and tossing us fearfully about on the ocean all night. Silent fear reign'd in our company, but some hardened cases went so far as to make sport in the midst of this exciting scene. Tuesday 13th Passed the \"hole in the wall,\" with light house early this morning. The sun rose beautifully in a fleecy cloud of golden hue, and a brisk wind drove us rapidly towards the Bahamia Bar, the day is clear, mild, and our Brig passed 5 other vessels this morning all bound in the same direction. Arrived at the Bahamia Bar, at 12 Meridian, and crossed it during the afternoon and evening; The water on the Bar is from 15 to 40 feet generally, and sufficiently clear in most places to see bottom at 15 feet. The bottom appears to be composed of white sand, with here and there patches of sponge. The color of the water on the Bar for about 60  miles is a beautiful light Skye Blue, whilst that of the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico is of a darkand blue color. we passed Berry islands this morning and saw there, a number of small sailing craft, and some about a wrecked vessel. A colored gentleman has a very fine farm, and several wives upon one of these singular looking islands. A good breeze drove us on rapidly ahead of all other vessels. The day has been warm clear, and the sun set among gilded clouds showing us a scene exciting universal admiration. Such a glowing sun set scene, few of us have ever before witnessed even in midsummer. There is something exquisite, glowing, brilliant and more diversified with brilliant and unapproachable colors accompanying a sun set scene in this southern chime, that seldom occurs to those farther north, and infinitely above the Artists pencil. [*Wednesday 14th *] Temperature mild, high and favorable wind driving us rapidly to the South west over the gulf of Mexico. No land in sight this morning. Saw several hundred flying fish this afternoon; the vessel appeared to scare them out of the water. We travelled very rapidly all this day and night.[*Thursd 15th*] Morning clear and mild, with a strong breeze driving us rapidly ahead, no land in sight. The gulf is here of a bluish brown appearance and occasionally when the sun is in a certain position of a greenish cast. Our vessel is now dashing off spray and waves of white foam as though she were ploughing by steam. One of our company Mr Chevallier, fell  down our cabin stairs this morning, but was not seriously injured, though stunned by the (long) fall. [*Frid 16th*] Morning clear, warm, and a regular calm. We were lying still at sun rise, but a breeze sprung up during the morning which increased to a strong wind during the afternoon, and drove us forward quite rapidly. This day was warm and clear. Saw many flying fish as usual with some Nautilus, & the Gulf waters appear now nearly black. The spray is flying skye high o'er deck, and we are dashing onward within about 550 miles of Tampico. Cool, high head wind, rough sea and day generally  cloudy, a day of but little interest. Cool, wind from the North, a strong gale with some rain, sea very high and disagreeable. Saw large schools of Porpoises, at several different times playing about the bow of the vessel, flying fish abundant, with occasionally some curious sea birds. This whole day & night has been exceedingly boisterous and unpleasant. Mon.d 19th  Morning clear, air mild, fair wind and travelling pretty fair. The sick ones of yesterday are getting lively again. no land yet in sight. pleasant evening and travelling rapidly ahead. Tues.d 20th  Morning clear, mild, with fair wind and rapid travelling within 200 miles of Tampico. Wed.nd 21st  Warm and clear. Gulf in a calm. discovered  land at 1/2 past 12 P.M. a fair breeze in the afternoon water of the Gulf getting quite green. The coast of Mexico ranges in barren and here and there partly cultivated hills. very Singular scenery. The pilots came out to us at 4 P.M. and took us into Tampico by dark, being up a small and crooked river about 6 1/2 miles. Vegetation &c was all green and the Spring verdure was here in all its richness fully displayed. The breakers running upon the shore were quite interesting and our entranceto Tampico over the bar was quite favorable. The  county about Tampico is in flats and broken hope  and there into low rolling hills of a peculiar  appearance, covered here and there with dense Chaparell. An officer boarded our vessel and examined  our passports, and we anchored off Tampico in the  river Rio Paneuco. Many porposes were playing  in the gulf as we entered the river. it was a beautiful sun set scene, and the weather quite warm.  we were not permitted to go on shore this evening. We have now arrived in Mexico, 20 1/2 days from  the wharf in Philadelphia. Clear. & Warm like August. landed this morning  at 10.A.M. in Tampico. went to the city Plaza and  examined strange costoms, dress, appearances of things &c. wandered with friends about town and suburbs all  day except when our baggage passed the Custom  House, when we had all taken to private rooms  rented for our company. Our impressions of Tampico  and the Mexicans in general, was at first quite unfavorable,  but in a few days becoming more familiarized with their  very singular manners and appearances, we felt more at home Tampico. State of Tamaulipas. Mexico. 23rd For one Real or 12 1/2 cts in company with a friend I crossed the  Rio or river Paneuco, to the shore of the State of Vera Cruz, from which place I sketched Tampico, as per plate No. 1. To a citizen of the States unaccustomed to foreign life, it at once presents an oriental appearance. There are two plaza's or public squares in the city the principal one facing the  river and the other back, upon which two of the Military posts and a small plain cathedral are located. The streets run generally at right angles, and three fourths of the  houses are one story in height, without chimnies, window glass, boards, or brick; being usually constructed either of bamboo, mud, or stone, which are generally plastered upon the exterior surface, and occasionally painted. The roof of each principal dwelling generally partaking of the usual Mexican trait, though more Americanized than  most other Mexican cities. The suburbs are almost entirely composed of cabins of Bamboo, thatched with the leaves of  the palmetto. The city is located upon a slightly undulating ground and almost entirely surrounded by water. The many singular plants with the beautiful flowers and foliage of spring combined with the lively colors of the dwellings, gave to Tampico, a singular and highly interesting appearance. The mainplaza, is paved with limestone (vide sketch No 2.) in the centre of which there is a large circular pediment of limestone rising in 6 steps, upon the summet of which there was once a monument of Santa Anna; which has been destroyed in their Revolutionary events. The building marked No 1. belongs to the British government; it is a costly and handsome establishment, and is  the head quarters for the immense quantities of silver, brought from the mines of San Louis Polosi. The markets are held every morning upon a part of this plaza. It is inferior to those in the States, though more abundantly stocked with the tropical fruits, at much less prices. Beef, fowls, fish, eggs, cheese, beans, peas, yams, tomatoes, &c with Lemons, Oranges, Bannanna's, plantains, sugar cane, coco nuts, with many vegitables supply this market at cheap rates. Almost every article kept by the Grocers, Dry good Merchants, hardware houses and other merchantile establishments of the States may be found here, but some of the are extravigantly dear. The custom house stands upon the main plaza facing a wooden pier upon the river. Coffee, sugar, rice, tea, tobacco and some other articles are virtually prohibited by their duties. Our party had about $20 worth of the essence of tea, the duties of which was over $30. No. 2 is the dwelling of Mr. Chase the American Counsil.The costom house officers are in general exceedingly punctilious and exact, but a small gold piece, has occasionally induced some of them as in other parts of the Republic, to put on  green spectacles. Our company of 40. were all presented to a tall thin and dignified praefect or chief Alcalde, who signed each pasport, for which he charged each $1. We occupied 3 large rooms in a retired part of the city,  near one of the principal barracks, and a part of the  time cooked our own provisions. We saw several military parades, as large forces were temporarily stationed here,  to prevent a rise on the part of the citizens of this city and State for independence, and annexation to Texas, or  in plain words Annexation to the United States. There was a patroll of small parties of Soldiers with  drum, fife, beaugles, &c. at almost every hour of the day. The complexion of the Mexicans is generally copper, bronze, and sometimes almost black. Their hair black and straight and their features partaking much of the Indian. I think  there is a marked difference between the features and the  color of the Spaniard and the Aztec Indian of Mexico, but they are called Mexicans. The real Aztec occupies generally the lower grades of life, but they appear tobe by far the most honest, sociable, polite, and hospitable. Though, as in other countries there are very conspicuous exceptions. The Sabbath is but little observed here, church open with most of the stores &c in the morning, and all closed in the  afternoon, for dances called fandango's, cockfights and other amusements, etc. You can get a good cup of coffee on the  plaza, or at the \"Caffe de Reverdy\" for a maydue or 6 1/4 cts. toast bread 6 1/4 cts. a cup of excellent chocolate one Real. 12 1/2 cts. eggs 12 1/2 cts per doz. about 2 1/2 lbs of coarse sugar for a  Quartee or 3 cent piece of silver. Flour is high, and bread dear. Tortelias are very common, when well made they are excellent, they are simply finely pulverized corn baked in large thin wafers, until they snap like thin sea biscuit. The Mexicans do not generally live as well nor in the  same manner as those of the States with some exceptions. I have however, tasted pastries here surpassing any thing of the  kind in the States. Good wine from 37 1/2 to 75. cts per bottle. Freoles, or black beans, plenty, cheap, and excellent. In  dress they are peculiar, with many varieties of fashion, and possibly as different from the Americans (in general) as may be found throughout the whole world. A tapering and broad rim hat called a Sombrero; often a tight  [*But meals are usually charged from 25 to 50. cts. and their appendages in proportion.*]and curiously figured buckskin jacket, over clean linen,  a pair of figured buckskin pants opening and buttoning up from top to heel, under the right and left arm, being small above and as broad as a Sailor below; they are generally unbuttoned as high as the knee or the pocket, exhibiting a pair of fine white linen pants beneath, which are also quite airy. The Mexicans are very clean in their dress, in this respect they far surpass the United States. Even our servants or mule drivers, were dressed in their  clean white linens; a thing most remarkable for this country considering their state of civilization. The Cargador or porter will carry a box or package, and yet appear not to soil his fine linen. The high tariffs of Mexico, prevent  the coarser articles from being imported, consequently the  Mexican markets abound with the finest foreign goods. The cloth, or linen is confiscated if it does not count so many threads to the inch when passing the custom house. Lands held in this country from old titles is good, but that from the government is not safe. Mr. Chase, our American  consul, says that during his stay of 15 years at Tampico, he has known the Mexican government to change 16 times consequently their laws, &c. are but temporary powers of vacilationIt is necessary to have a pasport to enter this country which will cost $2 in the States, to countersigned by the Alcalde of each large town you pass through within 48 hours after your arrival, costing at each place 25.cts. with also a pasport to leave the country; A passport to carry arms, and a passport to carry any amount of money beyond your expenses, at 25 per cent discount. Owing to the  reports respecting the country we had to pass over to San Louis Potosi, 5 of our number withdrew and proceeded by themselves. Mr Grant, then withdrew with a large portion of our company, leaving us but 19, which embodied a separate  mining company, having with them a large amount of mining tools, provisions, medicines, etc. amounting to considerable baggage which the other division thought would detain them some weeks longer in getting through to Mazatlan; consequently that party of 16 organized and proceeded some 5 days in advance of us, and procuring their horses at Mr. Laflers Rancho, or farm, they proceeded with dispatch to San Louis Potosi etc. Our party after selling off some unnecessary articles (as every pound to Mazatlan cost us 40 cts.) proceeded on the journey, having obtained our horses of Mr Lafler; 16 miles up the river of Paneuco. The other party of course expectedto be in San Louis Potosi, at least for 8 days ahead of our tardy mules and mustangs. They arrived in San Louis Potosi on the evening of the 21st of March, and our party at sun rise next morning to their surprise, as this journal from Tampico, will show. During our stay in Tampico, many of our party formed acquaintances in this city friendly to the Americans, a disposition evinced throughout the state of Tamaulipas. The weather here is quite as hot as august in the States,  but a fine sea breeze comes from the Gulf of Mexico, every afternoon; that makes our perambulations about town more pleasant. The Senioretta's or Ladies wear no bonnets, but invariably shawls upon their heads, I have seen some that were very beautiful; the early evening is their favorite time of appearance. This is decidedly a great country for moschitoes, ticks, and all kinds of loathesome vermin as we will herein after prove. The States bear not the slightest resemblance in species, quantities, and qualities to them, as they are positively the most numerous and most troublesome inhabitants of Mexico. To pick off 3 or 500 ticks from your pants and coat, as the cost of a venture in some places among the small weeds and bushes, might seem unreasonable, but such is very possible to occurSund 25th  The Priest, has extended an invitation to our company to  attend church. I visited and found but few present. The church is handsomely decorated inside but has a very  antiquated appearance without.  26th No rain and weather excessively warm, and moschetoes  innumerable, and insupportable. I repaired to the bluff  on the river, and from the highest part of it sketched  scene No 3, which comprehends an extensive and interesting  range of country. The first river to the right passing north  is the Rio Tamosee. West of it is the rio Paneuco,  a beautiful little stream meandering off towards San  Louis Potosi, and navigable 150 miles for light draught  boats, through no steamers have yet ascended it for. at fig. 1  is Laflers' Rancho 16 miles up the river; west of it for about  20 miles there is a level prairie. The Mountains fig. 2.  are interesting, as they abound with numerous ancient  walls, curiosities, and remains very similar to those discovered  in Yucatan, by Stephens. An ancient city is  supposed to have covered a number of square miles  on the summet of this mountain; which has been described by Norman of New Orleans. Beyond this west by south  two peaks of immense and distant mountains may be seen  occasionally by a clear sun set.South (fig 3) There is a long and beautiful Lagoona or Lake being about 2 miles wide, beyond it in the direction of Vera Cruz, there are high mountains and fertile plains. In the foreground there is a long tract of prarie, covered with the wild prarie grass, some chaparell bushes, with occasional  patches of low timber, and skirted on the margin of both waters with brushy trees, and one Rancho or (small) farm. [*Mond March 5th*] Weather warm, and yet no rain, but a pleasant  breeze each afternoon. Having all baggage in readiness and our bargains completed for horses and mules, we  embarked with everything belonging to our party in large canoes, in which we made the best of our way up to Laflers' Rancho 16 miles up the Rio Paneuco, to his principal farm or Haciendo, which I sketch'd as in No 4. Showing the Paneuco river, the neighboring mountain which contains its ancient remains of a past city on it and the curious forest in its foreground. This is the  best house on this river. This gentleman is an extensive landholder, his personal property extends  over more than 50 square miles, which he says he purchased some 12 or 14 years ago for $800. He came here originally from the State of Ohio. He has an immense tract, stock, grain, servants &c.and raises Sugar Cane, Coffee, bannanas, Corn, and  many other things, and is the only person I see about  this section of the country making brick. During our  short stay at this pleasant rancho, Mr Thompson, one of  our party obtained a guide over the river, and proceeded out to the ancient city upon the mountain; he reports the way to be difficult and exceedingly unpleasant, but he considered himself amply repaid in beholding some of the  scattered remains of old stone walls, parts of dwellings, implements &c. I was informed in Tampico, that a large  block of stone, appearing to have been part of a monument, was raised there, with an inscription upon the under surface, below it there was another similar block, which has not yet been removed. There are many very interesting matters there for the Antiquarian: Mr  Thompson having shot a deer, returned at Sun set with it, which  was very acceptable to our company. Our party were very much annoyed by clouds of voracious moschetoes, and other exceedingly repugnant insects swarming upon all the undergrowth and weeds of this region of country. At this Haciendo, our dinners were of the best the  country afforded, including a great variety of new dishes.Tuesd 6th Day clear and very warm; our baggage was repacked and carefully weighed; and likewise assorted for mule loads. Horses, mules, and pack saddles was the business of the day Wed 7th Day clear and hot. This morning opened with the buz of preparation for marching to Mazatlan; but for many unprepared considerations, it was postponed one day. Thursd 8th Day clear and hot. Having hired our mules, mustangs and four servants from Mr Lafler, and our guide Don Francisco, being in command as director of our order of march, as interpreter, Sub Commissary &c. and our other officers being elected -- and having carefully loaded all our arms -- we commenced our line of march, -- at 10 A.M. upon an extensive levil and variegated prairie. Westward ho! all in lively spirits; the first large city to which we  looked forward with interest, was San Louis Potosi,  a distance from Tampico of about 350 miles, though variously estimated from 3 to 400 miles according to route. The appearance of our company completely equipped with with guns, rifles, revolvers, knives, swords, &c. was anything but pleasant for a guerrilla to look at, some of which we anticipated meeting. half the day we marched upon a prairie plain, a part of whichhad no timber and scarcely any vegetation. We passed a  pleasant little lake upon which there was an immense quantity of wild game, that was easily approached. in the afternoon we got among some woodland hills, with  a small allowance of very bad water. Our road was only  a very indifferent mule path, and not passible for a  vehicle of any kind, and continues thus quite to S.L. Potosi. On the way we saw immense droves of cattle and horses, roving at large upon the prairies. In the afternoon we  passed a caravan from San Louis Potosi. The road being very dusty, the sun excessively hot, water scarce and bad,  and but little available shade; we were of course quite glad to close this days journey, in camp at a small bamboo hut, on the bank of the Rio Paneuco. - and an  interesting group of dusty travellers we were too, with  a regular saw mill appetite. Freoles, or black beans, with  coffee and corn tortelias, were served round for supper, and notwithstanding they were previously out of credit; they passed very current on this occasion. Our beds and blankets were then spread at random upon the  ground in the open air; and a guard of two set, for every two hours of the night, on the first of which I served two  hourswith my comrade Mr Bods, being from 8 to 10. An early Moon rose upon the meandering and placid waters of the beautiful Rio Paneuco, and a gentle breeze played  fitfully in the overarching foliage around over camp. This was a fit time to remind one of those pleasant evenings at home, of scenes in our native land. Friday 9th Day clear & hot. Got on march before daylight and marched 9 leagues, (27 miles) through a hot sun, dusty paths, winding hither and thither over small hills and bushy plains of no peculiar interest, with no dinner  and a short allowance of very bad limestone water. This evening we anchored again a bamboo cabin, on the banks of the Rio Paneuco, very similar to the last, and found a very short allowance of provisions at  this place. A part of our party went into the river to bathe and found the water quite warm. They were cautioned  however about Alligator gars &c, which are  sometimes dangerous. We camped again in the open air. Sat 10th Day clear & hot. Commenced our march before daylight; being 7 leagues (21 miles) for the day. Travelled most of this day over plains, covered with forest of  palm trees, with dense undergrowth of palmettos.from which the palm fans are made, this change of  scenery was new and very interesting to us. It reminded  me much of the descriptions of palm forrest in Africa and  India, frequently for miles we saw no other trees than  several varieties of the palm, sometimes scattering, and  at others compact reminding one too of the Jersey pines, when seen at a distance. These palms afford but little shade, and grow here usually to the height of from 40 to 50 feet, without branches or leaves, save only upon their very summets. An American unaccustomed to such  very singular scenes cannot comprehend fully from description the majesty they impose at first sight upon the mind of the lover of the wild in Nature. View us winding our way in single file, with baggage mules in advance, with coats off, and red flannen, as  conspicuous; with arms glistening in the mid days sun, the arrearo's or mule drivers singing out with their incessant \"mulah\", the guide ahead  smoking his cigaretto, or little paper cigar, and the  rest of the travellers following like a flock of spring birds in complete tune, and merry felicity, among dust, sunshine, and the shadeless forrests of palm. [*20*] In places however the palms, and palmettos arched over our road.and gave us a partial shade for a short period, then we would come up on an open plain, followed by a regular forrest of various trees, massive, dense, and overgrown with immense vines, and peculiar trees for occasional undergrowth; next a few small hills, then a brushy plane, followed again and again with the forrests of palm. Parrots and many other birds of gay plumage were very abundant and exceedingly noisy. Here and there the grass and brush have been fired and burned off for many miles. We encamped again at a bamboo cabin on the Rio Paneuco, very similar to the last, here again most of our party bathed in the river. I saw some diminutive watermellons at this Rancho, and helped to taste one. Our fare at this place was reasonable, but charges superior. The water is still very indifferent and strong of limestone. 11th Day clear and hot. Started early for a Rancho on the  Tamouin & Paneuco. 9 leagues (27 miles) The scenery of this day was much diversified and interesting with palms, plains, hills, gullies, brushes, and forrests. Among which I saw very many curious Banyan trees, or the wild figg tree. So curious were they, that if time had permitted I should have, certainlysketched a number of them. I think it is the same species of the Banyan tree of India. I saw several  cases of palm trees completely imbedded in the very trunks of immense Banyan trees, and being quite ornamental  to it. This tree returns from its from its branches direct  in a perpendicular line very frequently to the ground  in long cords like ropes, which take root and spring up again, in many shapes and sizes, and in many  cases more than a hundred times from one large tree. On this days march we saw several curious Mounds. We arrived at the Tamowin about 3.P.M, and after sending all baggage over with ourselves in [a] canoes,  we finished our crossing by swimming the horses & mules,  on the opposite bank we encamped at a large and  good looking Rancho, being at the junction of the  rivers Paneuco and Tamowin. Here we purchased a calf of good size for $.3.00, and prepared him accordingly, for further use upon the way. Water still unpalatable. This evening a part of our company were in to swim again. From circumstances we inferred trouble with guerrillas, but the guards were vigilant, and we left at 1.O.clock next  morning winding over way through a forest by moonlight.Mond. 12th Day clear & hot. Proceeded by early moonlight (1.O. clock) on our way for Villa de Viase. At sunrise we arrived at the first- Mountain on our way called the \"Siera Madre\" or Mother Mountain. Before entering the pass, the traveller will find a valuable warm Sulpher Spring, of great medicinal properties not far from the path. As you approach the pass, the scene is peculiar. You walk and lead your Mustangs over a rocky path, of such barbarous rudeness that you may deem it a venture for a Mountain goat, and yet your horse must be taxed with all his personal wits to puzzle his way out over loose rocks that edge over the precipice of an almost bottomless uncertainty. The mules, -they are as sharp as Chatham Yankees, for they will carry a load, where a common man would want room to tout over his own shadow. They are perfect baggage wild cats, and climb rocks with heavy loads as if they had claws, or were cammels in the desert of Arabia. We passed over one high and exceedingly dangerous precipice,  and other unpleasant places, and finally passed through a very narry and precipitous valley that meandered like the bed of a little river diagonally across the mountain, with almost the slightgrade of a rail road, and generally not much over 300 feet in width, but steep and of great height with timber on each side edging up the mountains, the meanderings of this cavern-valley  with its hight cliffs, and little coves and passes, gave to the whole scene a peculiar wildness and Sublimity. We scared up five young deer among the rocks; It was in this mountain pass that from report, we first  anticipated some Mexican Indians, or Guerillas; in this pass they could sweep and be safe; and although our guns were several times fired, none made their appearance to us. After crossing the mountain pass, we came upon an undulating country still uninhabited, though in many places of a very rich soil, covered sometimes with good timber and now and then prarie grass, with occasional barrens of wild and cavernous limestone rocks. Entrances to caves are to be seen, and in one place a romantic spot, an immense well of an oval form descends perpendicularly through limestone rocks to a great debth. Some ancient trees bend gracefully over and around its mouth. To day also, I found the remains of an ancient town and the appearance of an ancient fort on our way to the village de Viase. Revd Mr Woods and myself passed on in the advance of the trainMarch, 1849.  a mile or two, with the view of arriving at the village in  advance of the train. on the way just as we had pas a  slight bend of the road, we saw five uncouth looking Mexicans sitting on the bank of a dry creek; the wispered suspiciously until we came beside them, when they all arose at once with sticks, and gathered around us, supposing something rong on foot, I drew my gun from its sheath, and exhibited also my revolver and knife. Mr Woods prepared himself also by exarming his gun &c. These fellows followed us a short distance evidently meditating our arms, when they fell  off from us on being told that many Americans were just behind. We arrived in the village early in the afternoon, and found Mr Grants division just on the point of leaving for S.L. Potosi. This being the place where all our horses had to be shod for the mountains to come. We encamped on the village plaza, pitched our tents, prepared our own food, &c. Tuesd 13th Day hot and clear, examined the appearance of the village with friends, and obtained a good bowl of coffee two eggs and bread on the plaza for 1 Real, 12 1/2 cts. We have discovered that  Milk, Eggs, freeoles, tortelias, Oranges, and Coffee may be  readily obtained at almost every place; all of which  are very cheap, except coffee. On the Plaza of thisvillage there stands the remains of an Ancient Catholic Church. The Cupola is yet in a tollerable State of preservation and 3 bells yet hang in it of a very Anti- quated appearance. Upon its summet shrubs, cactus, grass may be seen as luxuriant as upon Terra firma. Vide sketch No 5. To the right of it is a long bamboo  building thatched with palmetoes; in it the Catholic citizens hold their Service. From appearances within we judge this chappel to contain more real wealth than many of those magnificent edifices of the States. This day was occupied in Shoeing our horses. Mr. Lafler of Tampico came in the village some 90 miles from his Rancho in order to have them properly attended too, the Shoes having been brought here from Tampico. The price of Shoeing here is from 3 to 5 dollars per horse, in the States about one dollar. Here they most generally throw the animal upon the  ground and tie him there with ropes. The Smith shops and other mechanical departments appear more like burlesques than the representation of a half civilized people. This morning I ascended the cupola of the plaza ruins and then beheld a beautiful view of the Siera Madre Mountains 12 miles westward as in Sketch No. 6.The foreground from the mountain was nearly a levil plane, intersperced here and there with apparent clearings, which in several cases proved to be small open and natural praries, probably never cleared by the hand of man, as they were not much used. A small rapid and romantic river passes under a deep bluff beside the village, where our party were again into bathe, as the day was excessively hot and the water agreeable. The peaks of the Siera Alta, appeared like a cloud in the distance. In offering a pass to the  traveller these mountains are very high and formidable. Just as I had completed this sketch the priest of the parish a very pleasant man ascended the tower and expressed much pleasure at finding me sketching, and thereupon requested me to descend and dine with him, to which I complied with much pleasure, in descending the tower in a shady recess, he placed my arms around  himself he also embraced me, with much feeling, and said that he liked the Americans. His dinner was served  up in the best Mexican style, with wine and numerous new dishes, served in about 8 or10 changes of plates. I left much gratified with his hospitality. Our horses being in readiness, at 4.P.M. we commenced our marchtoward the foot of the Siera Madre Mountains. In leaving and crossing the river by the ford, it was very gratifying to see about 90 or 100 Mexicans upon the high bluffs and along the road to see us out and bid us a friendly adieu, and Adios, adios, adios, was echoed here, there and yonder, which signifies - \"to God\"- we commend you. We travelled some 10 miles this evening and camped in a wild spot about 2 miles from the foot of the mountain. My sketchbook, a satchell, and a coat belonging to Mr Sayre, were lost after dark before camping, but 3 of us returned by moonlight before sun rise and found them. Our camp fire looked really interesting this evening with the sentinals parading around the sleepers who where rolled  up in blankets; who constantly watched among the timbers and bushes for enemy and wholves, the latter of which made themselves known before daylight. [*Wedn 14th.*] Day hot & clear. Arose before before daylight and proceeded to the Siera Madre Mountain. As we ascended, I observed numerous scattering mounds, parts of old walls &c, the timber became large and dense. I believe that there is a spring (the only one from Tampico to S Louis Potosi) not far from the road to the right as you ascend the mountain.our path over the mountain was in ascent by windings about 3 miles, and nearly the same in descending over the opposite side and other hills. The whole scenery was wild beyond description. Could this road or path be exhibited in a civilized country, it would be considered dangerous even for a mountain goat; how then shall I describe it, when a painter would consider it beyond a just representation if skillfully drawn. We lead our horses up the  steep precipitous masses, jumping and scrambling from  rock to rock sometimes two feet perpendicularly. The most ragged and cragged ledges, holes, chasms, and peaks that  the mind could picture for feats in horsemanship. Reader! you have doubtless seen nominally bad roads in the States, but they convey only a faint idea of the  hardships you must encounter in passing the formidable crags upon these mountains of distracted rudeness. Having surmounted the first Series, we descended upon  similar sharp and pointed edges into a wild and  romantic cove, leading off over and around other more  passable hills, in full view of numerous mountains ranging at random in every direction, until we reached the Ranch la Pier, by a small lakeupon a beautiful plane, and here we encamped for the night, having arrived early in the afternoon. The proprietor of the Rancho, is an Alcalde of wealth, and a man of affable manners. Before sun set we ascended a neighboring hill and sketched scene No. 7. including a large assemblage of distant mountains. The setting sun cast back their shadows upon the planes, as I descended, and lent a passing beauty to them ever to be remembered. From advice given us by the Alcalde, it was thought advisable to change our rout over the mountains to San Louis Potosi, by a nearer and more safe direction. The Mexican forces, and Indians or Guerrillas, being  upon the regular route, which would cause us trouble. The first division having gone that way unadvised, they met with difficulties, detention, and considerable danger. Thurs 15th Day clear & hot. Entered upon the nearer route, and passed palm forrests, old fortifications, and a fine little river, where  we filled our canteens with refreshing and cool water, the best from Tampico, and accomplished a long march and 6 or 7 formidable mountains of worse paths than any previously travelled. To describe our labours on these volcanic rocks of gothic masonry, would be romantic indeed.but suffice it to be said that this days march was  the most wild rugged and exhausting of any to San Louis Potosi. On this route I had the pleasure of discovering a  magnificent cavernous Amphitheatre of several thousand feet in diameter, and about 300 feet in perpendicular  debth, covered below with dense timber, and overhung with high arching cliffs of great magnificence. Our mountain scenery today was exceedingly grand though we enjoyed it but little owing to the difficult passes to be encountered. Many of the mountains had no timber, nor even vegetation upon them; being vast masses of rude brown rocks particularly upon their summets. Had time permitted, I should have sketched some of these alpine scenes of barrenness for the information and curiosity of my friends and readers. They are totally unlike anything I ever before saw  in point of complete barrenness and appeared really savage. At sunset we descended into a romantic valley and wound around several Sugarloaf hills, by dark into the beautiful village of San Nicholas, where we encamped upon a pleasant plaza of grass in the midst of the village and at the foot of a large and imposing mountain.but suffice it to be said that this days march was the most wild rugged and exhausting of any to San Louis Potosi.

Whilst watering our horses at a pond in this valley, two suspicious Mexicans appeared, one over the pond, and the other near us apparently examining our arms, &c. and in a short time one of them made bold to tell two of our party that  he was one of a party defeated by the Mexican Government, and that they were many, who were now in persuit of  plunder, both of them were handsomely dressed, and rode upon first class animals. We turned to the left from this interesting valley, through a pass in the hills similar to  No 9. when we came in view of the beautiful and-- romantic village of Tortugas, or village of turtles, where we arrived at 4 P.M. and located ourselves in a  small brush school house, upon a small riding ground well adapted to defence, as an attack of the Guerrillas was looked for, as quite certain during the night. Many of the inhabitants collected around us with curiosity and pleasure, as they hoped we would be of service to them in case of an attack of the Guerrillas or robbers. We were all in anticipation of a fight, when we saw a small fire upon the summit of a neighboring mountain, supposed to be a signal light. Guns, pistols &c were allwith here and there patches of stunted vegetation, growing among the wild mountain rocks. Among these I saw a number of strange and interesting trees, curious plants, magueys, palmettoes, coco's, and a strange fruit resembling the pine apple, being twice as large, and filled with numerous small soft white fruits, much resembling in appearance and taste the common chesnut, which were very abundant on one of the mountains. I also saw a shrub or bean plant bearing flowers, resembling skeins of white & red silk, from 1 to 2 inches in thickness, and from 4 to 6 inches in length. On this days march we passed through many very peculiar mountains, scenes of interest. No 9 (sketch.) was taken on horseback whilst passing into the valley of corn. No 10. is a view of the Valle de Maise, or valley of corn, looking to the north. This valley is about one mile in width, and many in length. The hills upon either side are nothing of nearly void of vegetation, the whole valley is divided into large fields for corn, and well improved with stone fences. The soil is rich and corn flourishes here luxuriantly. Far on the northern horizon a high mountain wasall of which grew from 4 to 15 feet in height, and chiefly among the interstices of the rocks. It appeared to be a  section of country almost useless for any purpose, and it  really appeared strange, how such a barren wilderness of  of thorns could be at all inhabited where water was  also very bad and scarce; in the afternoon we travelled among clouds of dust, with a hot sun and but little breeze. before sunset we encamped under a tree, beside, a desolate mud dwelling upon a deasert plane, much like a scene in the desert of Arabia, appearing quite as barren and  forlorn, as the immagination could well picture as in sketch No 13. A large old fashioned rope and pulley well, was in the  vicinity, at which about 40 Mexican women, were engaged in drawing water, and carrying it away in large earthen jars upon their heads, bearing a striking resemblance to the old Egyptian costoms, in dress, color, and manners. At this place we fared slim and paid well for it. Sund 18th   Day clear and warm. Proceeded on our journey at 6.A.M. very  anxious to get out of this barren and sandy wilderness. and travelled nearly all day over diversified planes of  limestone, palms, maguays, casters, some timber, and for a  mile or two, for the first time a woodland of beautiful cedars.put in the best order, our camp fire put out, and two guards put on duty. The Alcalde paid us a friendly visit, and many of the inhabitants brought us cheap provissions, and the night passed off without trouble. [*Sat. 17th.*] Day clear and warm. The inhabitants came in numbers to bid us a friendly adios. I pencil'd sketches No 11. and 12. just before leaving showing on No 11. our position in camp at the school house, and an opposite view looking South. Oranges flourish here, and are  very cheap, eggs are plentiful, with many useful articles of provissions. Soon after leaving this pleasant village, we ascended several large and barren hills, and in a few hours descended a very romantic pass down upon prarie plains and cultivated fields. our views on this days journey were extensive new diversified and interesting. We came to a  small village of a very romantic appearance, beside a little stream of water, where at first the inhabitants were much terrified at our appearance. We saw but little timber, during the whole day, the planes and  hills, being almost covered with wild cactus, prickley pears, and the short scrubby palms, etc.At intervals for several miles, the ground was as white as the very snow of a northern winter, having a saline taste, in places, in others that of Epsom Salts, and as fine as the very best flour. Caverns were beneath, for we  could often hear the footsteps of our horses echoing beneath, and now and then a chasm or deep pit would  appear. When timber appeared in the usual form of groups or clusters, it usually had a singular appearance, much resembling extensive Apple, and  Peach orchards. The country had conspicuous marks of a volcanic origin upon a limestone foundation. We were almost constantly in sight of distant ranges of lofty and rugged mountains, lending romance to the day. and now and then large planes, covered with prairie grass would extend for before the eye to the mountains skirted here and there with pleasant shady woodlands. We arrived at the Hacienda about 4. P.M. and were  gratified to find it a place much superior to the last,  not only for provisions, but also for shade and comfort. About 9.O.clock this morning we arrived at a place on the valley plane, where a stream of clear and very strong limestone water meandered from a small lake, and in a short distancedisappeared beneath the ground; this water though clear and cold, was so strongly impregnated with the Carbonate of lime, that though we were very thirsty, we could scarcely drink it. During a temporary halt, I sketch'd this lake No. 12 [*14*], and its vicinity southward. Game was plentiful here, and  several of our party delay'd some on account of it. Mr Sherman, one of the same , remained there so long that  in persuit of our caravan he missed the path and  was lost for a day and a half suffering greatly from exposure and other great dangers; after some delay, expense,  and trouble in scouring the country in various directions with a Mexican guide, he was at last found, much fatigued frightened, and sick, having encountered considerable perils. I remained some time behind the company in waiting for  Sherman, as long as I felt it safe from missing the way  myself, expecting him to come up upon this path, [during that time I sketched scene No 14. a high] on our right there was a high mountain [to] [the North] bearing the marks of a large volcano. Some of our party were in to bathe again this evening, but as our journey has elevated us much, the water is now becoming cooler especially each night, which is cold enough for two or three blankets, whilst  the mid day sun is quite hotMond 19th Day warm and clear. Proceeded on our journey at 7.O. clock. sMuch of this days journey was very similar to the last, at times winding among barren hills, small planes of cactus, thorns scattering palms, gullies and rocks, with small groves of peculiar trees of a stunted growth. Before sun set we crossed a beautiful and fertile plane under cultivation with corn, and haulted for a short time at a large well on one of the fields one and a half liles from, and in full view of the beautiful little town of Ceretus de San Juan; at the suburbs of which we encamped within a large yard for the  night. Before day light had left the hills of Ceretus, I passed through several parts of the town, and Sketched the church and plaza as in No 15. Showing the valley and hills eastward, over which we had passed during the after part of the day. The appearance of this little town is quite genteel the houses being mostly constructed of Stone and frequently whitewashed and as often secluded in pleasant Shady yards and groves of the trees and shrubs peculiar to this country.Tuesd 20th  Day warm and clear. Proceeded on our journey at 6.O.clock. Just as we were leaving the yard the horse belonging to Mr Thompson, taking fright at some object ran off through the yard, and brok his rifle into many small pieces, Mr T.--escaping unhurt. About 1 mile from  Ceretus, looking westward, I sketched scene No 16. showing the barren hills, a hacienda to the right, and the little clusters of bushes, dotting the ground like miniature islands. We were among the hills and ravines all day, and passed up one very interesting pass between barren mountains which was several  miles in length. On the way before entering this pass,  and at the commencement of a fine broad road, we  halted for a short time at a large Hacienda, called San  E Pedro No 17. having westward a beautiful mountain view, south the cultivated fields and distant hills, and around the dwelling several beautiful groves, over the principal door was painted in large letters, \"Casa Particular\". It being a public house or hotel of the  Mexican order. Having ascended through peculiar scenes of the passes, to the summet of the mountains, we then passed a long time over a wild rocky and entirely desolatewilderness, almost entirely destitute of the smallest vegetation, except in some particular spots, where small stone & mud huts of misery were now and then to be seen. Before descending we passed a small mud village in a little rocky and desolate ravine; with only a few cactus, thorns, and stunted brush, but no regular timber about it. It looked much like solitude and misery. The road has now become excellent, and for the first time we found it graded and paved as a regular road up the mountain. Wooden crosses are plentiful and conspicuous, they are more numerous now than on the way back to Tampico; Sometimes two or three in sight of each other may be seen and particularly on this days march. We are told that these crosses are erected upon the particular spots, where travelers have been murdered. if so, this is decidedly a great country. As we descended the mountain, winding our way down a dangerous pass, a beautiful plane, with a range of barren mountains 15 miles westward, appeared before us, which I hastily sketched as our party descended to the plane, as in number 18. This plane is about 15 miles in width, and almost entirely covered with a brush peculiar to this country.This plane, of the valley is quite level and of very great length, the camino that crosses it, is at least 100 feet broad, and would be an elegant road for travel if not so abundantly supplied with dust and sand. Our party were so much enveloped in dust, that during a portion of the time some of them were not distinguishable at the distance of a few rods. Clouds of dust arose high in the air, and marked in places the spots where persons were moving on many parts of the plane. Such scenes have however been long familiar to us from the very city of Tampico. At sun set we arrived at the \"Meson De Fern\" a public house called Pestelius located in a desert of sand, a few miles from a village to the north west and off from the road. At this place, we found Capt Grants' division of the Camargo Company, who met us in a sociable manner as old friends, the two divisions having taken different roads to San Louis Potosi.. Mr Chevallias' party of 5 having also arrived the whole Camargo Company were again together. At night, a high wind arose and gave us a complete storm of dust, exceeding anything of the kind that I have ever before witnessed in any country, reminding one of the desert of Arabia.Wednd 21st Day warm and clear. Capt. Grants division, left before sunrise in order to reach San Louis Potosi before night. Our company proceeded on the way an hour after, as we did not design pressing our horses and mules with a very long days march. Nos 19 and 20 are exterior and  interior views of the desert house where we camped. To the right of the house, there is a large well, which is deserving of notice; two or three hoses are fastened by beams to a vertical shaft, which by 8 right angle sticks move a horizontal beam, to which there is a wheel about 12 feet in diameter, with ropes and  about 20 leather buckets, for raising water from the  well to a trough, and from thence into a stone bason  about 60 feet square, and 8 or 10 feet in debth. This water was fair and cool, and very desirable for the country. Such wells are not frequent, and found only occasionally at the large Haciendo's or Ranchoe's of the wealthy. Water on this road from Tampico to  San Louis Potosi, is scarce, and in almost every instance very unpalatable, muddy, and dangerous to the stranger. It is therefore nescessary for travellers to be cautious in drinking the water along this route                                                                      in particular. This days journey was very similar to the last, with hills and dusty roads, with a hot sun, brushy planes, thorns, and large cactus of various forms, &c. Mountains of barren rocks were seen all day, but we travelled chiefly upon the planes. About 4 in the afternoon we arrived at the Rancho de los Soledad, previous to which I sketched scene No. 21 as we descended to the valley in which this rancho is located, This plane is very wide, and a very considerable length, on this plane about 30 miles to the left is located the city of San Louis Potosi, in full view of large Mountains, though not within several miles of any of them. No. 22 is a sketch of the Haciendo or \"Rancho de los  Solidad\", and its neighboring mountain, which I sketched before sun set, this scene is looking S. East. We encamped opposite to this in a large Mud wall with appartments for travellers as in Sketch No. 23. The inhabitants are now becoming less friendly than they were back over the mountains. And are decidedly against the Americans in the popular feeling, and have occasionally expressed those feelings with insults, and a few words of contempt, which some of them have learned from the American deserters, in the English language. We have seen a number of these contempitible shadows of white men and almost as often heard their curses, or indecent language, but we have generally left them unnoticed. At this rancho we saw a large amount of arms and lances, with an American Rifle, pistols, swords &c which led us to suspicion the character of the place strongly; we however kept our Arms and Sentinels in good trim, and were ready at the word, to show them that in defence we were the same original Americans that they might have before read about. Had our numbers been small enough to suit their taste, I have no doubt but that a fight would have resulted judging from all circumstances, questions, &c. Being in the neighborhood of S. L. Potosi, it is now absolutely nescessary to be constantly on your gard for all shapes of thieves, Robbers, Guerillos, &c., etc, etc. who appear to compose a large proportion of the population. [*Thursd 22nd*]  We left the Rancho, this morning at 3. O. clock for San  Louis Potosi, the road was broad, and lined with cactus, from 5 to 15 feet in height. We were all awake for any attack on the way. Having travelled 15 miles by 1/2 past 8.O. clock A.M. we entered the Splendid and singular city of San Louis Potosi, having passed through a beautiful little village before entering Potosi. The city is situated upon a large and beautiful plane, which is under good cultivation, and is for several miles in every direction; divided into regular right angle  \"streets and roads. The fences of the roads, if they may be so called are composed of the high pentangular cactus, growing in single stems of about 5 inches diameter to a  height of about 8, 10, or 15 feet, and frequently so close together that it is generally capable of shutting out the smallest animal. The average width of the streets are about 30 feet. A member of large and handsome species of trees range along them, with which I am not familiar, one of which resembles in bark, limb, and  site, the Locust, with leaf of a small fern. Another, has the shape and height of a poplar, with the denseness of the black thorn hedges of the States; it is a  beautiful tree of a dark green color, and very ornamental. The maguay is another peculiar plant, very abundant here; I have seen fences made of them extending many miles at a time, and very common everywhere  onour way from Tampico. All these interesting plants, trees &c. with a large number that would be  difficult to describe, but which nevertheless are exceedingly beautiful, belong to this country and are so abundant as at times to cover many miles in compact masses, so much so that it would be difficult for a man to pass among them as they all, with but little exception possess luxuriant crops of  thorns. All these species crowd the roads and surround the fields as you pass into San Louis Potosi. I also for the first time saw two peach trees in full blossom in a beautiful garden at the suburbs of the city. And many beautiful flowers of singular beauty were in full bloom likewise and filled the air with the richness of their morning fragrance. Several fine fields of ripe barley added to the view, their mellow orange hues, whilst, the plough (a rude woodden concern) was busy beside. The Orange, Lemons, and fig trees were also handsome when blended with their fruits, beneath other more conspicuous trees, among which was one called the Peru, another the China tree, andyet another larger and decorated with more exquisite brilliance than I have ever before witnessed. all these with their charming colors and luxuriance bent gracefully over our dusty roads as we passed into the great central metropolis of Potosi. The morning sun had already arrisen upon the domes, towers and minarets of Potosi, as our company entered it from the North. There was so much of the grand and the humble combined, that I could not but remark its resemblance to what I had read of St Petersburg and Moscow, as described by travellers in Russia. After wending in single file our tortuous way amid dense crowds of strange brown faces, around the various streets of the city we at last took up our quarters at the St Anthony house, which was commodious and  constructed strictly after the Mexican order, and one of the first hotels in the city, though, not by any means adapted to the ideas of Americans, being very similar to sketches Nos. 19. and 20. The suburbs of the city (which are very extensive) are almost entirely composed of miserable looking one story flat roof'd mud dwellings of a dilapidated appearance which are much inferior to  the [*34*]very lowest order of dwellings found in any part of the  States, and contrast in a very striking manner with the numerous splendid sanctuaries, public buildings, towers, domes, and superfluous grandeur of the interior city. None of our company even dreamed of the surprising splendours, which broke so suddenly upon them, when they entered the thronged plazas amid the thousands of vacant gazers who seem'd to view us as some unearthly intruders, just draft among them from some other plannet. Our ideas were never so much unhinged at when too closely crowded by dense throngs of starving Mexicans, who with wondrous eyes and  open mouths, Knew not in decency where to end their extravagant curiosity. As we entered the  streets were quick ly thronged, the windows and  iron gratings filled with Seniorettas or Ladies, the doors with wise heads and muchatcha's of boys with some upon the very house tops, to the  Americans enter into the precincts of their almost forbidden walls of China. An unfriendly feeling towards the Americans was soon evident from their language  as it was a day of religious ceremonies, and rest from labor, the church and plaza was thronged, by Mexicans dressed in their holliday best. We passed through this pleasant town, without halting and ascended a steep, high and rugged mountain at the immediate suburbs of the town. On looking back towards Amattitan, distant 14  miles to the South east and Tekelah at its base I hastily sketched the view as in No 59. On ascending this mountain I saw an animal of the Lizard Species about 2 feet in  length lying upon a large boulder rock in a ravine. After ascending we passed several miles through a  a deep, [and] very narrow, and crooked ravine among the highland hills; it was perfectly adapted to the purposes of Ladrones or Robbers, and has been recently the theatre of bloody deeds, robberies, &c. Here jet black Quartz began to appear plentiful after passing in single file for Several miles under the arches and bluffs of this wild and narrow ravine, we descended into a small and pretty valley, where there was a small farm, green fields and some water, from  this we ascended large hills, almost composed of  [*35*]the same brittle jet black quartz, before named. So much so, that it was hard upon the feet of our animals, we again descended into a gently sloping valley of about two miles in width, at the far northern end of which we could see the interesting Lake of Madalena, which I sketched on a nearer approach as in No 60. Showing the town of Madalena on the margin of the Lake, beyond which that welcome sheet of water with its interesting mountain scenery appeared, reminding one much of similar scenes in Italy and Switzerland; and rather unlike many other Mexican towns. At this place we stopped in a comfortable mason overnight, halting about 4 P.M. An opportunity offering I went and upon the margin of the lake and sketched view No 61 looking west among the mountains over which the sun was setting. Also No 62 looking south east towards part of the town Madalena is a town of a shady and pleasant appearance. Most of its streets are narrow and crooked, but well shaded in general. The plaza, was of good size and had a fine large antiquated church upon the south eastern side of it. Around which there was a large crowd of worshippers,uncivil manners, and in two of our party being stoned upon the city plaza; all of which we readily discovered and were particularly cautious, in being upon our guard, whilst we were frequently rendering civilities for incivilities. To these however we are happy to state that there were a number of exceptions, among the higher classes, and the better informed, which gave us a better opinion of Potosi, than we otherwise should  have had. We were nearly three days in this interesting city during which time whilst our guide was preparing fresh mustangs &c for our further journey to Mazatlan; and having some opportunities, I availed myself of them in visiting and sketching some of the massive and beautiful churches &c, having first obtained permission from an alcalde's clerk in the Governors' Palace, to visit and sketch as I wish'd. I proceeded in company with an American friend about 1 1/2 miles south from  the city, towards the Mosa Mountain, where from the remains of an old mud fort, I sketched the domes  &c of the city as in No 24. nearly all of which belong to magnificent churches erected many years past by the Spaniards at enormous costs, and decorated  in theinterior with gorgeous and the most exhorbitant displays of wealth and splendour that the human immagination could well conceive of, and far exceeding any thing of the kind to be found in the States. An open plane of more than a mile in extent each way extended between the fort and the city, upon which several hundred Mexican soldiers were exercising with targets, drilling &c. At this time large forces are concentrated here, who appear to be preparing for political struggles for power. To the right of this open plane, there are four parallel rows of the beautiful Alamo trees forming a shady and a very pleasant walk of about one mile from the city proper southward to the front  of the magnificent sanctuary (Santoario) as in fig 25. At each end and along this walk there are handsomely ornamented fountains. No 25 is a view of the Sanctuary and Mosa Mountains from the same position, where fig 24 was taken. A nearer view of the Sanctuary was then taken from the front near a fountain, as in fig 26, including two fountains two neat gardens, and the style of seats surrounding the principal fountain. The workmanship upon this magnificent edifice appears to be a contribution of the various orders ofArchitecture which in execution I believe to be superior to any thing similar which I have seen in the States. Not even excepting Trinity Church in New York, and composed of a hard red sand stone very similar to the one named. This church though over a mile from the city was under military guard, from whom I asked permission to enter but was told that the chief key of the Sanctuary was in the posession of the Captain, who was out drilling his  men upon the plane beforementioned. On returning to the city we passed a number of handsome edifices of  singular and antiquated appearance, but my opportunities limited me in sketching many of them. The streets were thronged in almost every direction, and should one attempt a sketch in their presence, a crowd of noisy gabbling superstitious men, women, and children, would soon compell a retreat, at the risk of being stoned, amid the jeers, and language suiting degraded and grossly ignorant minds. I was told there were over fifty handsome Sanctuaries or churches in this city, which from appearances I doo not doubt. None but the Catholic religion is tolerated here as in other parts of the Republic, and in passing each Sanctuary, even upon the opposite side of the street, the person is required to takeoff his hat, and retain it in his hand, until he has passed the door of the Sanctuary, otherwise he is liable to be stoned at the shortest notice; if nothing worse may happen him. I'm entering the church during service he is required to kneel, and to accompany respectfully in the ceremonies of the church. The interior splendors of these numerous churches, I could not describe in justice within my present compass. Their displays are gorgeous in the highest degree of man's ingenuity; and frequently exhibit much of the Theatrical; in some instances the walls and high gothic roof, being entirely covered with thousands of gothic (relief) devices, are entirely gilt with gold or silver leaf, until the whole interior glitters like a solid golden palace, with richly ornamental chandaliers, lights of various colors, hundreds of Statues of life size, adorned in robes of brilliant colors, gems, in great profusion, magnificent organs, select gallaries for the paintings, relicts, and statues of the saints, in one apartment of the St Domingo Sanctuary I was shown the bones of saints, and such other things as would fill a volume to describe.On returning to the main plaza, I sketched the Palace  of the governor as in fig 27. a crowd of noisy belligerents soon manifested a a jeering aspect, which compelled me  to finish my sketch rather hastily. I then passed off hastily until I had eluded the noisy crowd of  ignorammus's and by permission getting upon the  roof of a house. I sketched therefrom the beautiful  and very extensive Sanctuary of \"San Francisco\" as in  fig 28. showing its domes, cupolas, and spires as it appeared from the North east corner. Its bells  are numerous of many tones, and remarkably fine; the  interior like an immense museum, is crowded, with  wealth, and splendours beyond description. It has  as near as I can judge over, one thousand apartments,   a part of which are very elegant in their styles, guildings,  statues, paintings, stuccoed works, altars, tombs, vaults,  organs, galleries, painted domes, stained glass, chandeliers, massive gilt gothic works &c. &c. It covers a large  square, and is almost a royal city of itself. I after proceeded  to the Church and College of St. Josephs, which I  sketched as in No 29. My visits also extended to the magnificent  Sanctuary of St. Domingo, the front of which wasGuarded by a large mounted Cannon, and in a house, beside it several hundred soldiers. The interior of this great  church was the most gorgeous I ever beheld, its walls  and gothic ceiling was so gilt with gold leaf, as to appear  like one immense golden gothic palace. The Captain  of this division politely accompanied me through the  church, explaining its sacred relicts, &c. Among which  I saw immages of Angels, about 4 feet in height appearing to be cast of Gold, encased in splendid cases over  the grand Altar. A similar image of the Virgin  and Saviour sitting upon a throne of very massive  silver clouds, over which was an immense dome  inlaid with porcelain of rich colors. There was A large and  beautiful Organ upon a highly ornamented gallery, resting  upon Lions, that seemed watching the congregation,  And numerous saints in richest robes, (of nearly full  size) were to be seen in every direction. The interior  forum of the church was that of a cross, having two  magnificent Altars. I asked permission to sketch this  fine church from the little plaza front, but was  told that it could not be granted, without a  special permit. I then proceeded to sketch theyards, with numbered cells, in which from 10 to 30 may sleep on a brick pavement, having their own blankets of course. There is usually a cook shop in one of these cells, called a \"Fonda,\" where coffee, meat &c. are prepared to order, and usually well charged for; although the cooking may be very inferior to any thing in the States. In chocolate, however, the Mexicans excel, and sometimes in coffee, and especially in light sweet cakes. March  25th.  (Sunday)  Our company (of between 40 and 50,)  Left San Louis Potosi this morning at half past five, in double file presenting to the gazing crowds quite a military face, as red flannel was very conspicuous on almost every man, for almost every coat was off, it being clear moderately warm, and very dusty for a time. In the distance the city appeared beautiful and interesting. We soon entered upon open and barren rolling hills, where I found several handsome specimens of agate scattered among gravel. I neither heard of, or saw any of the silver mines of this State, though I believe them to exist in Durango, Zacatecas, and the state of San Louis Potosi, as large silver trains pass down to Tampico from this country, every few weeks. [*38A*]about 10 miles from San Louis, we entered upon some very rocky hills, into deep ravines, several narrow vallies and through narrow passes, with a cross here and there at short intervals, marking the spot where some traveller has been murdered, and his remains, if poor, deposited beneath. Our company was composed of over 40 American two Spanish guides, 8 Arrearos' or mule drivers, (Mexican) and 14 pack mules to carry our baggage allowing 150lbs. to each mule in order to travel with speed and safety. Our guns, pistols, swords, knives, &c. were all ready for immediate use, and were kept in excellent order, and many of our boys made the vallies echo with their jovial songs whilst passing, at the same time keeping an eye for any vagrant Guerrillas among the cliffs and brushes. One of the narrow vallies through which we passed during this day was peculiarly romantic, whilst a broad creek filling nearly the width of this valley of precipices, meandered with it; the bed of this creek, was in most places almost dry, so that we travelled some miles upon beds of gravel. At one place, on passing up the side of a precipitous, volcanic hill, I saw a very great quantity of handsome Geods of Calcedony, scatteredchief plaza looking eastward, including the fountain The Parroquia, a fine church, and a small part of   St Domingo east of it. A crowd of idle male and female spectators soon assembled around me bobbing continually their ugly phiz's directly in my face, so as interrupt, and intercept the view I was sketching -- presently two officers in military uniform, arrested me, and proceedded with me to an Alcalde's office, at the left base of the Governors' Palace. He wished to know  if I had a permit to sketch, I informed him that I had from the Praefectas' Clerk; upon which he discharged me and sent an officer (in uniform) to accompany me to my former seat on the Plaza, who stood by me with drawn sword, and like a gallant man kept men, women, and boys, at full bey, until I had finished my task, when he left me with a polite bow, &c. No 30, represents that sketch on the chief plaza. This plaza is almost always densely crowded by  all grades and classes of people, who stare as much as Americans, as though they were Bedouin Arabs; No 31. is a red sand stone fountain, which I sketched in the Southern port of the city at the head of the Allamo                                           walk before described.It is much of the time crowded by visitors for water, No 32. is the chief market plaza; upon this plaza are numerous Doric pillars, well finished from red sand rock, it is intended in time to place a roof upon them so as to shelter the market to be held therein. This view is looking north, at the present time the markets are held around the principal building. A good cup of coffee can be had here for a Mordeau 6 1/4 ct and mellons with many other things proportionably cheap. At this date 25th March, water mellons &c. are plentiful and cheap; the markets appeared flush with delicious fruits, oranges, mellons, cantelopes, bannannas, &c. etc; but no apples or peaches; no walnuts, chesnuts, or hickory nuts, yet similar though better than the market of Tampico. The scenery about San Louis Potosi is in places romantic and interesting when combined with the distant mountain scenery of the Southwest; the contrast of mud huts with splendid edifices and the superb residences of the wealthy are very striking and is the first thing to be observed by every traveller. At this place, they are decidedly hostile to theAmericans, partly I presume from the late war and in part from religious education. At evening the  Host, or priests, pass around in a fine carriage, drawn by mules; before which a number are seen walking, each carrying his candle, whilst several small bells, are tinkling to the heavy toll of deep tone'd bells of the Sanctuary every person male, female, young & old, must Kneel to  the host whilst passing This is a strict religious  ceremony, the nonobservance of which brings at once  upon the head of the disobedient immediate dangers  either in being stoned, or possibly something worse,  besides inculcating the ill will of the observers. In  San Louis, though there are English, French, and  some Americans, yet they are much more strict  in Religious observances than in Tampico, and  Americans should be more on their guard in  passing into the interior of Mexico and westward. As near as I could ascertain, the population of  San Louis Potosi, is about 75 thousand. The proportion of which are illitterate Mexicans of the Indian  race, called Mexican Indians. They are usually clothed  indifferently, live similar in mud huts, upon mud  floors, andlead a servile life, or one of complete indolence. Our Company remained 3 days in San Louis in order to purchase some fresh Animals, shoe others, and prepare for our further progress to Mazatlan. The two divisions with others joined in order to leave Potosi together, so as to make a display of arms, as we were informed that 70 armed guerrillas had preceeded us to the mountain passes in order to rob us, as it was currently reported here that we were in posession of a large amount of gold, and going to California to remain. It is well known that a large population of robbers live in San Louis Potosi, whose chief business is to watch and rob travellers, which makes robberies every day affairs in this country. The Mexican Indian population of this part of the Republic, seeing the monopolies of the government, have rebelled and endeavored to first down the present government with that pretext, and at the same time committing gross outrages and robberies under that cloak, by themselves. I am not aware of any Hotel in the American style existing in the whole city of San Louis, Masons or public houses exist there, which consists of squarefor at least a half mile upon the pass, No 33. is a hasty sketch taken offhand in passing a part of this interesting valley, having a large gravel bed in the foreground No 34. is a sketch of curious mountain looking west, from the summet of a gently sloping prairie hill, after having ascended from the narrow passes, and large hills on the east to this much more elevated country. In the afternoon we came upon an extensive open prairie with a gentle slope of miles, without timber and covered with parched grass, so that there was no shade, with an abundance of dust flying in considerable clouds. Several times during the day, Mexicans, richly dressed, and well mounted upon firey steeds, would ride into our ranks, bow politely, talk for a time, and then disappear, we judged them to be the guerrilla spies, and took good care to show them our determination and strength of arms. Just before sunset we arrived at the Hacienda of Tepetate, the proprietor being hostile to the Americans, would not permit us to occupy the Mason, so that we were compelled to camp out not withstanding the night proved to be very cold; we raised our camp fires, and soon prepared excellent though plain suppers, which took their usual round in messes. A strict guard was set, and the1849. March. night passed off without molestation, although anticipated before sunset I took sketch No 35 of Tepetate Hacienda. (Monday)  26th  Day clear and warm. Commenced March this morning at 6. O clock. The scenery ahead was extensive, pretty, and interesting. Several of our men were on the  sick list to day, but nothing very serious, except one man who had his arm broken some days back of San Louis Potosi, but he is now rapidly improving. Our journey today extended 18 leagues, the same as yesterday and one horse lost on this days' march, on every day event with the numerous trains on this route to Gaudalaxara. During the day we passed over a hilly country and  then upon a gently rolling country covered with immense fields of wild cactus, prickly pears, and other thorny plants usually from 5 to 10 feet in height, and often extending thus as far as the eye could reach, without any relief of other plants, &c. I found some pretty specimens of Chalcedony by the way. At evening we arrived at the Hacienda of Novelia, about 100 miles from Potosi. A pretty green valley was spread out on the right, and a similar valley to the left, whilst we descended upon the rocky side of the hill as inNo. 36 into the right hand valley facing the southwest, we camped again in front of a Mason, and they were still hostile towards us. At night a cloud dark as Egypt rol'd o'er us from the North West, with a short but heavy shower, accompanied with heavy thunder and lightning. Our baggage escaped by being carried under shelter, and we passed a very uncomfortable night. About eleven at night when darkness reigned in blackness, a noise like stampeeding or stealing  our horses and mules took place. 7 or 8 of our party immediately proceeded to search for the intruders with loaded arms, but found none there except our mule drivers; An hour after some alarm was created by hearing about 40, reports similar to the firing of guns in quick succession over in the next valley; we were however ready for any guerrillas or other intruders, but they did not trouble us further, as we fired salutes a number of times which echoed along the valley like sober precautions. [*Tuesday 27th*] Day clear and warm. Commenced our march at 6. O. clock, and crossed extensive open, dusty, and hot prarie plains. By eight in the morning the Sun generally gets warm and quite hot by nine, which continues until the customary evening breeze springs up from 12 to 5. O. clock.About noon we passed a romantic village where I sketched the church in No 37. but did not think to learn the name of the village as I was much in the rear when I drew it, besides being attacked by a noisy pack of wolfish dogs. To day we began to find plenty of palatable fruit upon the prickley pear plants that were very abundant on our way; which became more ripened as we advanced. We passed around the base of a lofty and barren rocky mountain into a magnificent valley, where could be seen many handsome Haciendos, ranches little lakes walled up, with strong stone breastwork, extensive fields under good cultivation, some of which were irigated by fresh running streams, woodlands, a small meandering river, orange-groves, and other marks of civilization, besides another long and very beautiful village, along a broad and shady road, very unlike what we had seen since leaving San Louis Potosi. It was really an extensive or far reaching valley of civilization handsome ranches, and a garden spot, among the barren praries and mountains of Central Mexico. Rabbits (with long ears and) of uncommon size, were very plentiful, 7 and 8 have been started at a time, of course we made some fine meals from them; A fine fresh breeze blows yet each afternoon from the Gulf of Mexico but in a few more days we are told that it will blow from the Pacific Ocean, towards the east each afternoon at the same time though opposite to that from the Gulf of Mexico. Before Sun set we landed at a rancho called \"San Nicholas\" a dilapidated rancho unlike much of this fine valley which I sketched as in Number 38. here some of our party were in to bathe, though the water was cold, being considerably elevated; water mellons, eggs, &c. were abundant and cheap, and the mellons of excellent quality. Notwithstanding we might here occupy rooms in a  Mason, yet most of our party preferred sleeping out in the open air, although it was somewhat cool at night. At this place there is a small church, which from the peculiarly rude paintings of Deer &c upon it, I would judge to be very ancient among modern things; it has however a flat roof, which is the customary Mexican fashion of building, except where they have become partially Americanized.Wedned. 28th. Day clear and warm. Commenced our march at 6. O. clock for a short days travel of only 15 miles to the beautiful city of San Maria Del Lagos, which is located down the same handsome and fertile valley as before described. Our road was broad, well setled, and abounded with shade, water, and pretty scenery, whilst we were most of the time in full view of the two opposite mountain ranges of barrenness on each side of this pleasant valley of groves and gardens. We entered Lagos city, over a small but handsome stone bridge, by a broad road, quite equal to some of our American McAdamized roads, and of very pretty and romantic scenery. We entered in double file with the pack mules ahead as usual, and presented quite a line of a military face, as each had his coat off, exhibiting uniformly red flannels, and plenty of well kept arms. Multitudes gazed upon us with apparently great surprise and curiosity, to which we have now become accostomed. After winding about for some time along the various streets, &c, we at last came to quarters in the \"Mason De Merce.\" Crowds soon surrounded our wide spreading archway,to sell us mellons, oranges, sweetmeats, etc. &c. In company  with a friend I visited the Market plaza, where I  purchased a fine cantelope for a Quartelia a 3 ct. piece,  a bowl of buttermilk for a Tolacco, 1 1/2 ct. piece. A good  water mellon for a Quartee, 3 cts. a box of excellent  preserves for a Tolacco, 1 cent and a half, and a good  bowl of coffee for a Madeau or 6 1/4 cts. This is the  only place where I ever saw Ice cream for sale. A number of delicious fruits crowded this market, that  we never see in the States, some of which we found  wild along our road. Near the Market there is a  fine large public plaza, well built up with stones  of the first class, with shade trees, many good seats,  and a handsome fountain in the centre. On the North  side of this plaza there stands one among the most  noble and massive Sanctuaries of Mexico, and usually  ranked among her chief churches, which I  endeavored to sketch as in No. 39. it is build of a hard  light red sand stone approaching a cream color; I did  not obtain its dimensions, but it is certainly larger than  any church which I have ever seen in the States, and  in workmanship equal to the finest church of New York.It rises in Lagos like an immense collosal pile, a great monument of perseverance and skill,. It has been erected about 40 years, and towers above the city like St Peters' at Rome. The interior is still more splendid than its exterior, gorgeous displays of wealth, immense gothic works in gold and  silver leaf, are suspended from the far off ceiling, an organ, richly decorated is supported by a beautiful and curiously formed gallery, Pilasters of great height trimmed with silver leaf, rise between and separate very large and brilliant paintings. Statues, here and there decorated with costly dresses, gems, &c occupy their several positions whilst the chief  Altar is a piece of work of great expense and  magnificense, [whilst] and a high arching dome throws its many color'd lights down upon the rich counter colors of the chief Altar, and gives to the whole a peculiarly beautiful appearance. Bells of great magnitude (originally from Spain) toll at various hours of the day in concert with the other church bells of the city. By permission I ascended the only tower in which the great bells are suspended, andfrom that massive stone cupola, I sketched scene No 40.  looking south west over a portion of that fertile  valley before described, and a part of the city of Lagos,  including several fine churches, and the nunnery &c, showing two important table mountains in the distance, the present bed of the river, which is now nearly dry, and the flat rooves of the city; with a small part of the public plaza. This is the most interesting section for a view out of four, as it comprehends only about 1/4th of the city, and time would not permit me to sketch any others in this interesting city. The delay of a half day at Lagos was occasioned by our horses and mules requiring some improvements in shoeing, thus affording me a short period for sketching. This town includes about 12 thousand inhabitants, and is apparently a thrifty and stirring place of considerable neatness and beauty, though in places antiquated. This afternoon at 2.O.clock, a party of 7 Americans and 5 Frenchmen arrived here from Verra Cruz, and the city of Mexico. They met with troubles and dangers by the way, and were very glad to join in with our company in going to Mazatlan, which a part of them did in dangerous times.[*Thorsd 29th*] Day clear and warm. Commenced our march this morning at 6.O.clock, for the beautiful city of \"San Juan Del Lagos,\" a place of about 7 thousand inhabitants, and about 12 leagues distant from the former. More than half the days march was over a dry and barren country. We approached within a very short distance of the town, before discovering it, as it was  situated in a narrow and very deep valley, and hardly discovered until we had got nearly over it, when we descended a paved road directly into the city of life, and dense crowds of curious spectators. The scenery of this deep and narrow valley, with its meandering  water course, and the distant mountains, was peculiarly  barren and wild; but the town had pleasant orange groves, gardens, &c, with shady walks and fountains here and there and a very handsome plaza, upon which  was the largest and finest Sanctuary we had yet seen even surpassing in magnitude the one last seen,  this was indeed a stupendeous pile of human art and perseverance; a sign informed us that its age exceeded 100, years, and it was yet in an excellent state of preservation. In front of this grand Sanctuary therewas a handsome fountain in the centre of a public plaza, surrounded by seats and in a circle of small Allamo trees. Most of the houses were highly ornamented with various colored devices, whilst rows of massive collonades, made the plaza scene quite agreeable, which was very much crowded by the inhabitants, and the market plaza was in its immediate vicinity. No. 41 is a sketch of the grand Sanctuary of \"San Juan Del Lagos.\" in magnitude and external beauty it exceeds the other at San Maria  Del Lagos, but in its interior magnificense it is about the same though still more expansive. The floor of the interior is inlaid with porcelain of China of various colors of chequered work; and the same upon the outer surface of the great dome. The workmanship of the steeples (which are very high) is considered inferior to none in all Mexico, certainly I never before saw any similar work equal to them, either in Mexico, Canada or the States. Time would scarcely permit a careful sketch of this massive edifice, and night closed upon me without my being able to get others from other positions, of fountains, churches, and a view of the city &c. As our party left early next morning no time of course was available for further sketches.[*Fridy. 30th*] Day clear and warm, Commenced our march at half past six O.clock, crossing a large and costly stone bridge, the handsomest and largest I had yet seen in Mexico; it was handsome and built entirely of a light hard free stone; toll was paid in crossing it. a paved road wound around and up the hill in a serpentine form until it reached the summet, from which there was a splendid view of the town, river, churches, groves, &c; we passed from this pleasant view into another very steep, deep, and narrow valley; from which we arose again to follow a rolling barren country of prarie hills, covered here and there with fragments of loose broken rocks, and much broken chalcedony. An Alcalde with Lady, &c. has accompanied our train for several days, keeping near us, and travelling in a regular Mexican carriage drawn by 6 mules, four of which travel abreast, with a driver sitting upon one of them, the whole affair appeared clumsy. He usually stopped at the same Masons with our company; he was evidently travelling under our  protection from Ladrones or robbers, as the Mail and several Mexican gentlemen were then dooing.about 9.O. clock this morning a body of 3 or 4 hundred Mexican soldiers passed us, followed by many women and children, the whole of whoom were on foot except their officers. At the head of one of their companies was an Irish Deserter who addressed us in the usual language of contempt whilst a number of the soldiers spoke to us in Spanish and a little in the English. They were bound for Rio Verdy, a town of importance towards Tampico, in order to put down Queros and his party, who were opposed to the Government of Herrara. During the after part of this day we passed over an extensive country of open rolling and barren praries, exhibiting scarcely any thing else but rocks, gullies, parched grass and in places an abundance of dust. At evening we landed at an old dilapidated rancho, where provisions were scarce and dear; the name of this rancho was \"Lavent,\" which I sketched and No 42, at sunset. [*Sat. 31st*] Day clear and warm. Commenced our march this morning at half past six O. clock, having only 7 leagues for the day For the first time, we now passed through a valley of gentle undulations, having a very red soil, that  was under cultivation, and appearing to be productive, along the valley there was about a half mile to the right,a high hill appearing very much like an old dilapidated pyramid, which was the opinion of several who saw it. During this mornings march, we passed through several small villages of scattering mud cabins, inhabited as usual by Mexican Indians. About 1.O.clock we descended a paved road into a broad ravine, and after crossing a bridge ascended upon the side of a low spreading hill into the town of Tepatillan, where we remained until the following morning as it was too far to the next rancho for the day. Before night [nigh], I sketched the church as in No. 43. the age of which is nearly a century and a half. It is a plain building, very large, and of an Antiquated appearance. This town contains about 6 thousand inhabitants; having a neat and pleasant appearance about the plaza, and chief streets. The walks of the plaza are all followed by ranges of very large and spreading shade trees resembling the Oak though more expansive. In the centre of this plaza there is a handsome fountain, and on the South Side of it, the town market, and opposite under a long colonade where the Alcalde's office was located. A young man from the States, was arrested [here] by some Frenchmen andimprisoned here on a charge of stealing two hundred  dollars, which he protested against strongly. Most of  our company visited him, and by much taking with  the Alcalde had him taken from a miserable cell  of crowded polution, and placed in better quarters,  we could not get him released, and had to leave him  at the mercy of his enraged enemies, and the Alcalde  believing him to be innocent of that charge, although  he frankly acknowledged having stolen 60 dollars  in Mexico, whilst in distress. Upon which acknowledgement  the Alcalde made out his commitment. The  Frenchmen (we were afterward told.) Said they would  wait until the Americans had left, when by some  means they would get him out, and kill him in the  mountains. The whole appeared like a sad affair. I felt sorry for the young man for we could not  render him assistance without endangering our own  liberty. The feelings of the whole American Company  were against the Frenchmen, who treated him with  severe abuse. He was a delicate young man of about 20.  and said that he had left a widow'd mother and a  sister in the States, and he pointed to a ring on hisfinger, and said that this was the only token of theirs now in his possession, and that at night in his cell, the Mexicans had wrench'd his finger repeatedly to get it. If he escapes, it will be by some miracle unknown to wiley Frenchmen, and stupid Mexicans. This evening the host passed around the plaza drawn in his superb carriage, with the usual ceremonies. April Sund 1st Day clear and warm. Commenced our march at an early hour. The first part of the day we passed over a rolling and barren woodless country, with mountains in the distance. In the afternoon we descended into a lower country a large valley extending many miles and somewhat of a triangular  form as in No 44. In this valley a stream meandered along which in places woodlands appeared. At one place on a low and spreading hill, beside this stream, was located a very romantic and beautiful little town, the admiration of all our company. It appeared to be one forest of very tall orange trees, with bushels beside bushels laying thickly strewn upon the ground in almost every direction with small and neat cabins scattered here and there through these extensive groves. Most of the orange trees  were over 20 feet in height, much resembling largeapple orchards. Among the rest of the pleasant things to be observed here, was a cool and refreshing mountain spring of considerable size rushing rapidly in various branches down the quick descents of several of its streets. Shaded by palms, cactus, orange groves and shrubbery, We passed in sight of the plaza; where I saw a neat looking church. About 4 or 5 miles from this village we passed through another, less shaded, beside the same stream, and near a fair looking stone bridge. Still continuing in this long valley, just before sunset, we came to a river of good size, and descending a long slope lined on either side with Mexican cabins, from a  large mason on the hill, down upon a very large and antiquated stone bridge, upon which were four square towers, upon two of which were statues of the King and Queen of Spain, with an inscription beneath nearly obliterated by time, upon the other two towers were statues of monks or fathers. we crossed this large bridge and put up at a mason on the opposite side in the little town of Tolololotlan, after passing up a street of cabins of more than a mile in length, we found our Mason. I then proceeded in company down to thebeautiful banks of the Rio Grande or San Antonio, and sketched  the great bridge as in No 45, looking north from  above on the west bank of this interesting stream. On the opposite or North side of the bridge of  Tolololotlan, the whole river pitches over large  masses of rocky boulders with a heavy lumbering  roar that can be heard for several miles before  reaching it; above it spreads out to a considerable  width dotted here and there promiscuously with  small and interesting islands, with green meadows  rolling hills, and the lofty blue mountains, all of which  forms a highly picturesque scene, which I endeavored  to sketch as in No 46. On first beholding this fine  little river, it may naturally be supposed that we  rejoiced at the first sight of a stream that emptied  into the great Pacific Ocean, and it seem'd to make  us feel that a part of our great journey to California  via Mexico would soon draw the land chapters  to a grateful close. On the following morning by early light  I sketched a part of the interior of our Mason as in sketch 47.  where the earthen flower jars were plentifully ranged  around the tops of our mason columns, containing  shrubs &c.1849. April. At this place we fell in company with a small New York party  of 8 or 10 persons, and learned from them, that one of  their party had been shot in the head by accident and  killed instantly, it happened at a bridge not far from this  place; the father of the deceased was present in the same company. Mond 2nd Day clear and warm. Commenced our march at 6.O.clock for 8 leagues. Passed through a small cove, and then upon a high plane  where there was a considerable pond or small lake, and  afterwards crossed a deep ravine upon a stone bridge by a  small village, a place noted for robberies &c. and from thence  proceeded over a hilly and picturesque prarie country until  we ascended a considerable ridge, in company with a very  large burthen train of miles for the great city just ahead. On descending this slope into a somewhat lower country  a distant view of Gaudalaxhara, broke upon us as in  sketch 47. which I hastily copied by the way, being then  within about 6 miles of the city and looking North west. Before arriving at Gaudalaxhara, at 4 miles distant, we  passed through a small town of a very pleasant appearance  in which there was the remains of a once superb sanctuary. A handsome shaded plaza with a curious fountain,  and a tall and handsome dragon fountain at the North west  suburbs of the town,on this plaza sweet meats, lemonade, and other  mild drinks with Polka, a drink sweeter than cider, with oranges, mellons, bannannas, and other fruits were very abundant and cheap. the exhibition of which presented quite a pretty appearance as they were promiscuously ranged about the fountain plaza beneath the broad spreading shade trees. From the suburbs of this town to the suburbs of Gaudalaxhora, there is a broad Mc Adamized road 3 miles in length, with 4 rows of spreading shade trees, principally of the Allamo with others of very great magnitude, as in sketch  No 48. extending its whole length, thus dividing two pleasant and shady walks on both sides of the principal road, which was about 50 feet in width, about 100 feet including each walk, this road with its neighboring scenery and a distant inkling of the city presented quite a pretty and interesting appearance. We entered the city in double file, with pack mules in the advance. The suburbs appeared very extensive, and it was at least one hour before we reached our Mason, as we seem'dGaudalaxhara. continually winding hither and thither, among a continuous crowd of strange brown faces and peculiar scenes. Having arrived in one of the handsomest and greatest cities of all Mexico, I hastened to avail myself of every opportunity to explore and discover its fine arts &c. In entering we passed 4 or 5 very handsome public edifices but time would not permit me to sketch them except in a  general view. an aqueduct of water, at first mistaken for a regular canal with stone bridges, abutments and its handsomely finished breast works crosses the southern part of the city proper, along it there are shady walks of trees great Magnitude and age, with fountains in shady places,  and fruit plazas in various directions; watermellons were vastly abundant, and cheap, piles of them were seen on almost every little plaza, where any fruit might be sold. As near as I could ascertain the population of Gaudalaxhara, was about One hundred and seventy five thousand which I believe is about the correct estimate, as it appears much larger than Baltimore, M.D. April. Tuesd 3rd Day warm & clear. Our company concluded to remain in this fine city over this day to proceed early on the morrow. Of course I saw and sketched as much as possible. [*31*]The city is very regularly laid out in right angle streets, usually from 20 to 40 feet in width public gardens and several fine plazas, besides market squares variously. It is considered more than twice as large as San Louis Potosi, and the most beautiful of all the cities of this Republic, and second only to the city of Mexico in size. It is located in an interesting valley, and surrounded by barren mountains in the distance, and elevated several thousand feet above the level of the Ocean. A part of the valley about it is under very good cultivation and presents an extensive and civilized appearance. Every thing combined with a pleasant breezy afternoon, such as we had on entering Gaualaxhara, - a prettier scene could scarcely be found in any of the Northern States of Mexico. It is much admired and spoken of by all travelers who have visited it. Its communications with other towns is conducted entirely by mules, and horses, and all goods carried upon the pack saddles of mules. So that the main roads leading each way from the city, is almost constantly crowded for miles beyond the reach of the eye, with thousands of horsemen, and pack mules, going and returning in large companies.Near this city such scenes are really so animating that it would seem almost incredible were the number at one single view given. Dust is of course very plentiful During this day I visited many parts of the city, the interior of several splendid churches, public buildings, gardens, cemetaries &c. The main plaza, is the most splendid of all that I have yet seen in (all of) Mexico, and said to be handsomer than that of the city of Mexico. It is in the form of a square, followed by Allamo shade trees upon each side, with neat seats, and a handsome fountain in the center. The buildings which surround it are of the first class, and bear much resemblance to all the old Spanish edifices of Spain. The streets which Surround it, for nearly a mile in every direction, exhibit great displays of wealth, fashion, business, and refinement. There is a custom much used here, of covering the pavements with long and massive collonades of one and occasionally two stories in height. Almost every house, building, or edifice, excepting the finest sanctuaries, have the usual flat rooves, and generally a very massive appearance, somewhat similar to Egyptian customs. [*52*]Here strange scenes and strange brown faces, that - densely throng the plazas, markets, groves, [and] fountains, and beneath the long and massive colonnades, makes the American feel at once his absence from home, and his isolated position among the most strange of foreign countries. Strange customs, ceremonies, dress, and modes of living seems to transplanted you at once into another and different world. Go where you will, you are a stranger, and a strange object of gaping curiosity, even to the Soldiers in the Official Pallaces, who would treat you respectfully with small presents of fruits, and politeness, and permit you to intrude on forbidden ground, whilst a common mexican for the same intrusion without a permit, might find a sharp whack upon his callabash the consequence. Among the litterati and official circles of this city there is certainly less hostility to the Americans, than among the illitterate, half Indian, and Servile population, and those on the way back to San Louis Potosi. On the main plaza, there stands an immense Sanctuary of great dimensions and magnificense: It occupies asquare of itself including a grand wing called the Cathedral, as in No. 49. The chief building under the larger dome being called the Sagrario, all of which is now being repaired and repainted with superb interior displays. It is the grand Sanctuary of this city and among its finest buildings for interior displays, which are immensely grand and very elegant; gems, Saints in splendid attire, magnificent Altars, Organs, paintings, large immages apparently cast in gold, over the Altars, inlaid porcelain, work, stained glass of various  colors, beautiful silken draperies, massive silver ornaments, gothic columns, and gothic domes gilt with gold and silver leaf, until the whole glittered by the evening lights like some fabulous golden palace for beings above the common things of mortality. No such scenes of granduer can yet be found in the States, and I have been repeatedly surprised at the enormous wealth, which must have been lavished upon these religious pallaces in Mexico. judging from the time, and immense labor required in their completion; and in their superior pieces of Sculpture, Architecture, and paintings, with their mammoth bells, and [*53*]fine toned Organs, superior castings, elegant designs, drapery, massive granduer, orders of Architecture, and fine materials, which at this day, far exceeds the small and half civilized capacities of the original Mexican inhabitants. From Spain all this display of wealth, &c has originated, been cast, planed, carved, painted, and then transplanted upon the planes, vallies, and mountains of Mexico, and there set up profusely all over the land in immense colosal monuments, whilst Mexico was under that Government. From this beautiful plaza I proceeded towards the aquaduct Southward, where getting upon the flat top of a Mexican Mason or public house, I sketched scene No 50. looking North East, towards some of the mountain ranges, and over the prettiest part of Gaudalaxhara, which I selected from the four views, showing a part of the aquaduct a fine large church, a part of the Hospital in the distance and a fine long park. The principal part of the city rises upon a broad and gentle undulation to the left of this aqueduct, the face of which is dotted here and there with handsomepublic edifices as in this view (No. 50). I then  proceeded to a fine public garden about a mile  from this location, in which I took sketch No. 51. I suppose that it covered about 8 acres, being larger  than any of the squares of Philada. In the centre  of it there was a large fountain, from which fine  walks passed off in each direction. Shade trees  of great magnitude covered the square, whilst the beds were full of beautiful shrubs in full  bloom, which on entering presented to us the appearance of a beautiful shady grove richly and  closely carpeted with many species of flowers  so ingeniously interwoven as to show the  figgure of one large flower by the shades of  those planted together. This I have seen  in many places through Mexico. In this garden  there was a fine large revolving swing with 4 seats,  similar to those in the States. This was a large and  very beautiful garden and appeared to be a place of fashionable  resort. From this place I proceeded towards  the aqueduct and sketched a curious fountain in  the long park as in No. 52. From this fountain [*54*]I proceeded about two miles to the northern suburbs,  and passing several beautiful churches of curious  Architecture, I came to a large enclosed Square, which  proved to be a cemetery; apparently of recent origin.  in the center of this square [was] I sketched No 53.  which is a handsomely ornamented and chequered frame with two interior apportuents which were  beautifully ornamented and richly decorated within  No 54 is a sketch of a beautiful freestone monument in the same enclosure. Directly facing No 53, and at  the opposite end of the same pavement I sketched  the grand collonade building as in No 55. each of those  square chambers along it are intended for two or more  coffins, the door of which being closed has upon the outer side the usual inscription of the tombstone. Day light prevented further sketches , though I would have taken many more if the opportunities would have  permitted. The market plazas were located in  several parts of the city, and were crowded to  excess with watermelons and other fruits. and on  one plaza exceeding any thing I had ever seen in  Mexico, and a most beautiful sight too, as everythingwas very tastefully arranged, even to the different colors of Lemonades, &c. Many fruits were abundant here that are never seen in the States.  most of which are sold at reasonable prices. After leaving the cold winter of the States and comming so suddenly into hot weather, dust, mellons, and oceans of fruit amid a Summer heat in Mexico  you may well suppose that we are quite sensible of this change; whilst we often remarked to each other, that our relatives at home little thought that we were now feasting upon the  finest mellons in the world, whilst the cold winds of winter were whistling around their homes. I doo not think that there are more churches here than in San Louis Potosi, notwithstanding this is so much longer than the former city of Potosi. I visited several fine churches, but had no  time to sketch even a small part of the great beauties I saw during even this one day. Though vehicles of any kind were seldom seen through  the country, yet heavy carriages of a clumsey - [*55*]   appearance for the aristocracy and the Priests were quite plentifull in townThe americans still continue to arrive in this city, 40 more during this day from Mexico. Wed 4th. Day clear and warm. Commenced our march at 6.O. clock. On leaving the city, we passed the walls of an extensive prison, which was being erected of stone, at the North Western suburbs. The road was broad, very much crowded, and almost one continued cloud of dust for many miles out of the city. About four miles on the way we passed a neat little village, with a magnificent Sanctuary or public edifice, therein of enormous dimensions and square walls enclosing some 8 or 10 acres, with very high (18 or 20 feet) iron railing in front which was ornamented and gilt, and ranging a full square between delicate pillars and light arches of stone. Some of our party supposed that it was the Bishop's Palace. About 12 miles from the city we passed a tall gate; it was a high stone gate crossing the road in one arch about 35 feet in height with a large Mason, and a few scattering huts about it. After this our road wound aroud large hills, deep ravines, through several narrow passes, and for the first time in a great distance, among numerous large pines, oak bushes, &c ranging over desolate looking hills.At about 20 miles from Gaudalaxhara, I made a hasty sketch  looking west as in No 56. showing the mountains and a small part of the lower valley country, which is somewhat below  the valley of the city we have just left. This is a celebrated  part of the country for Robberies, and we were even told in Gaudlaxhara, that two hundred, Ladrones or  Robbers had left that city the night before us, on our way  to cut us off at about 30 miles out. We did not however regard it, knowing the veracity of Mexican reports  which generally had some other crafty object in view. At about 22. or 23 miles from the city, we came upon an open prarie of rolling or undulating knolls, a part of which had them been recently burned off, on this black charry and dismal looking place, there stood  a large and high gallows, upon which were suspended  the bodies of three Robber chiefs; they had been suspended  there about 3 weeks, and were ghastly looking objects, bullet holes preforated their dried bodies in many  places which were nearly ready to drop to the earth.  over them was a large painted Sign, as follows -  \"Thus the Law punishes the Robber and the Assassin\". Only a few weeks before we arrived here these men [*56*]were chief actors in some bloody deeds, about this place, until some of the government troops overtook them with the justice they merited. The number of these Robbers are said to have been about 200 strong, committing  constant depridations and murders upon travellers and many of the regular Mexican baggage trains. This scene was to melancholy a picture to sketch, so that I left it for a more fit object and about 3. miles further west, as in sketch No 57. I copied a peculiar mountain and small village, to the right of which our road continued its torturous course. In the afternoon as we descended into a third interesting valley, our mountain scenery became extensive, very lofty, and peculiarly wild, moreso than we had yet seen them. Upon the right and upon the left were seen towering mountains, with immense barren cliffs above cliffs, and their numerous rugged woodless spears rising high in the air like collosal ruins of pyramids of yet untold of magnitude. To the west this great triangular valley tapered to our interesting focus, at the far point of which the sun was setting amid a few light and beautiful clouds.whilst the mountains diminished gradually as they receded in the background, all of which formed quite an intersting and beautiful landscape view though very wild. We then descended a hill into the lower valley, and took quarters for the night in a mason, beside the church on the market plaza of the town of Amattitan, being about 40 miles from Gaudalaxhara. Before dark I ascended a high precipice of rocks east of the market plaza, and sketched No 58. showing the square, the big walled spring facing the market, part of the church, part of the town of Amattitan, with its shade trees, with a part of the valley, and the mountains on the western horizon. Here we found plenty of mellons and other fruits all which were quite cheap. Our company here numbered over fifty. A part of them sat by moonlight under the broad archway of the gate of our mason, until 9. O. clock singing in concert, the national songs of America, some 60 or 70 Mexicans, crowded around them seemingly much delighted. About 9.O. clock a Mexican having stolen a purse, from Mr Hassan, was persued and shot at by him, which scattered the rest in short metre.The Alcalde, called next morning and commeded Mr Hassans' course, by saying that he wished Mr H. had killed the thief; it appears that he was wounded, but got off with the bead purse. We were informed at Gaudalaxhara, that this town was, and had been a celebrated rendezvous for the mountain Robbers. &c. [*Thurs'd. 5th*] Day warm and clear. Left Amattitan by early sun rise, and continued our march North west across the valley, among rolling hills of gentle slopes, having small rancho's here and there at short periods; this days road was peculiarly interesting in its scenery we saw to day many fields of the maguay plant ranging over many gentle hills, and upon some of the few fertile spots along the wild mountains base. They make a mild drink from it called  Polka, also the Ardiente, which is stronger than  whiskey, which I believe is made from the magauy also. About 11.O. clock A.M. we passed through Tekelah a town of some importance, noting perhaps 4000 inhabitants. It had a fine shady plaza, upon which stood a very large and antiquated church. On the plaza, fruit appeared in great abundance, andgoing through their usual ceremonies. fruits were abundant and 18, oranges were  bought here for a Madeau or 6 1/4 cts. Orange groves compose the  chief shade of the town. Several very large springs or rather small creeks, breakout of the hills east of the town square, and meander in rapid streams through several of the streets. The water was of a slightly milky cast, and an unpalatable limestone taste. At night the moon rose full and clear, with an occasional flitting cloud, and a gentle breeze. This night a band of 40 Mexicans, all [each] well armed with muskets, pistols, swords, and knives; - presented themselves in double file at the gate of our Mason, or Hotel; and demanded quarters there for the night. Our landlord believing them to be robbers told us to prepare our arms for service, which we did in a few minutes. The Landlord then told them through their captain, that his apartments were all full, and that they could not have quarters in his Mason, to which their captain answered that they would come in in defiance of him and those within. The gate of the Mason which was very broad, and of one expansive arch; the doors of which being open, the Robbers drew themselves up in a compact body immediately before it on the pavement and street. Our landlord stepping forward told them that they must wait a short time until he could see further about his accomodations. But he immediately passed out by another way from his Mason, in pursuit of the Alcalde of the town, who in a short time came with him to our quarters. The Alcalde enquired of their captain who they were, where from be. They answered that they were government soldiers; He then demanded of their captain, their passport as government soldiers, - but they could show none besides the said company acknowledged having travelled on two days, which by the laws of Mexico, no government troops, are permitted to travel. By their dress superabundance of arms, and statements the Alcalde judged them to be a band of ladrones or Robbers, following us, and not improbable that they were a detachment of a larger body, sent in town as government troops, in order to stop overnight in the walls of our Hotel to take us by surpriseand most probably after stealing our arms, then to attack the town, which is a common occurrence in many parts of Mexico. The Alcalde told us that he believed them to be Robbers. He evidently feared them. He told us to see that our arms were all in order and ready for execution in case we were attacked. Its a matter of course all our men were prompt in self defence, and with our guns, pistols, and knives, in hand and about us, we drew up in order, compactly before the door, facing the Robbers, who stood quietly facing and viewing us as mute as a posse of terrified owls; the Alcalde and our landlord refused them admittance into our Mason, but they would have entered by force had not our company presented a bolder front, headed by Capt Grant, of Philadelphia; who told them that they should not enter, except at the peril of their lives, at the same time every trigger was ready to tell. A moment of suspense, and they decamped in quick step up to the town plaxa, where they were permitted to stay by the authorities. After this the Alcalde came several times to ourquarters, telling us to put on extra guards, which we did, even upon the high walls, in order to stand sentinel over our horses as well as our other property, and persons. The Alcalde told us that there was a probability of either our company or the town being attack'd during the night, and wished us to promise that in case the town was attack'd by them, to assist the citizens and his little military force in putting down the Robbers, which we promised, and on the other hand he told us that if the attack should be directed first towards us, his people should assist us, but that we must not mistake and fire upon a religious procession of the citizens which would pass our Mason about 3 O. clock in the morning. This was an evening long to be remembered from many circumstances. It was a most beautiful moonlight night, and now and then a gentle breeze played fitfully from the beautiful lake of Madalena; My turn among the sentinels came from 12 to 2 O clock in the morning; and my positions around the high walls, and the expansive enclosed yards, was pleasant and romantic during so pleasant a night as this; seeming at times like a dream, that I were facing therounds of some ancient castle and looking down among the  dark shades of the groves around slumbering in silence beneath the full and magic moon. I stood upon the house top, meditating upon the beautiful Lake of Madalena, the mountains, standing off in deep shadows, the many flat rooves, the groves and the rocky cliffs near the town; about 2. O. clock a procession of the citizens took place; proceeding from the church and passed our Mason. It was headed by richly robed priests, who were chanting solemn airs; a full sized wax figure of our Savior, of full size, clothed in mourning with a crown of thorns, representing Him as passing up to Mount Calvary, whilst before Him were carried several hundred candles, with several hundred Mexican ladies following each with candles, accompanied with an excellent band of music, the whole was a peculiar scene. Before day light those Ladrones or Robbers before named had all disappeared, having preceeded us on our road through a formidable mountain and vastly grand ravine country, of deep cavernous valleys, suiting such a class of beings.1849 April 6th bay warm and clear. Commenced our march at  half past six o clock, winding our way around that beautiful and interesting lake of Madalena. Formidable mountains appeared in full view and an immense country of sugar loaf hills, sharp peaks, several hundred of which might be seen at one view from elevated positions, at times we passed over a graded road, upon which considerable pains had been taken, about 10 A.M. we descended into a very deep and curious valley of about two miles in width, passing down which it spread out to higher rolling hills with very deep chasms for water passing around these hills and amongst them variously. About 12  meridian I sketched Scene No 63 which was a large Hacienda, westward appeared very large mountains, between which and the Hacienda one several tortuous ravines, the deepest and most awfully grand that I ever saw, being more like immense caverns than ravines. through which we passed about 15 miles. They are called the \"Baranca's\". a road descends upon the  almost perpendicular face of one of them, which is very tortuous and romantic; as you might see the train quite beneath us.winding their way far down the deep cavernous  valley of the Baranca's; as in No 64. with high and  barren Mountains, sparcely timbered towering far above  these numerous deep Barancas. Passing along these  deep narrow vallies, we crossed several times a rapid  creek of some magnitude, over which in many places  high brown rocky cliffs, and various timbers,  bend gracefully over its romatic and noisy waters. No 65. is a sketch passing down the creek in this valley. No 66. do a short distance north west of the former sketch,   with high frowning bluffs of brown rocks. No 67. is another  passing father down the stream, where the road ascends  and again descends to the creek; after fording which  upon rocks [upon] from which the water was bounding  away rapidly; we ascended upon the opposite side,  where a small race of water descended to a pleasant  little dwelling, about which fine timber, several  species of very high cactus, and underbrush with luxuriant  grass were seen forming a highly picturesque  and romantic view. But our train passed so rapidly  that I was much in the rear with my last sketches,  and had to omit this pretty scene for one whichfollowed shortly after as in sketch no 68 where we came to  the junction of apparently three triangular vallies, or deep passes of the Barancas, and the junction of the two fine streams of fair water. At this place there was a pleasant Rancho over the creek, with little groves of oaks, pines, cactus, Bannannas, and beautiful green meadows. Our train turned round and up the left hand valley. And presently  came to scene as in No 69, very high, barren, and steep mountains of almost no timber, arose high in the air, with slight misty clouds around their summets; upon the side of one of them a road was seen ascending which is a view of a part of a graded road, cut over this great mountain by some foreigners at an immense cost, and in most places blown through the solid rock, and of excellent workmanship. In this little valley there was a mill of some kind in operation with a large horizontal wheel. I was afterwards told for the purpose of washing out the silver ore beneath the road, seen on the mountainside, there is a small and pleasant village, in which there is an abundance of fine fruits and surrounded by extensive green fields, meadows, groves, and fine timbers along the stream that meanders through its valley, that spreads  out to a ---triangular cove, dotted with several pleasant Rancho's, No 70. is a sketch taken on entering this pleasant cove where the village was located. After leaving the village we commenced ascending the mountain road. Time would not permit me to sketch as much as I desired, No 71. shows the workmanship on our fine road over, one of the most formidable mountains in Mexico, it is cut out of the rocks, and walled paved and graded thus all the way up this mountain for a distance of six miles. and as great a piece of work of its kind, as any that I know of in the U States of America. No 72. is another sketch farther up this fine road. The view from the Summet of this mountain looking eastward was fine indeed; including many a green and beautiful valley and more mountains, peaks, knolls, hills, vallies, dales, coves, and verdant spots, blended with wildness and prarie hills, than I had ever yet seen in all Mexico; and was really grand beyond description. The mountains far east about Gaudalaxhara could be seen like smoky shadows of deep blue mist. It is said that we have ascended to day, more than  7000 feet, above the deep Barancas through whichwe have just passed; and still a peak arises to our right, around which we wound our tortuous way looking over walls, that looked straight down upon abyss's that were quite beneath us thousands of feet. I found enough here for days of sketching, over which we passed rapidly as it was a region said to be well filled with Robbers, and frequent to many scenes of bloodshed, robbery, and other vile deeds; a few desperate men in these wild mountain passes could doo much harm even to a  large party. On the summit there is a rude breastwork evidently thrown up for that purpose. Cliffs of huge brown rocks here hang over frightful debths and thousands of deep ravines cut deep into and down the rugged mountain. This is our highest elevation  in crossing Mexico, we have gradually ascended 7000 feet to the Barancas, and about 7000 feet again to the summet of this grand dividing ridge of Mexico, making in all an elevation of about 14000 feet above the levil of the Sea. Upon this height we now have the afternoon winds from the Pacific Ocean; and from this forward to the Pacific each day, blowing uniformly from the west, and sometimes very strongly.We now commence our gradual descent toward the Pacific Ocean, an event of some interest to us of course; leaving the scenes east of the great Cordilleres, for those descending gradually into the mild and fertile vallies on the  great western side of this distinguished mountain. No 73. is a sketch of the first scene descending into  a beautiful and fertile valley, along which are plenty of Ranchos, several small villages, several sugar  mills, fine farms, meadows, groves, and plenty of small Mexican dwellings, shaded by Bannanas, Plantains, or perhaps the Allamo, or at times the spreading oak. A pleasant stream of water meandered along this  valley, the margin of which was thickly interwoven with brushwood, wildflowers, and followed by pleasant green meadows, which contrasted in a striking manner with the shadeless, and wild barren mountains; that were broken and rudely tossed into the high air as the fierce storms would toss the waters of the mighty ocean; and as rudely wild, and void of vegetation or timber in many places. This day we have made a march of 54 miles, and arrived at our Mason in the town of [Eastlan ?] a hour after sun set. It appeared to be a fine largetown; at sun set I sketched Eastlan at a distance of a few miles to the  east, being in advance of a part of our train, which during this day got much scattered on the way. There was a fine large Church in this town, with a large shaded plaza or public square, upon which there was a grand display of many  kinds of fruits, drinks &c. including watermellons, Oranges, Bannanas, &c. &c. with Lemonade; Polka, etc. A grand procession of the virgin Mary took place, this evening parading in large crowds the various streets of the town with hundreds of Ladies and Gentlemen each in procession, carrying their separate candles. The immage of the Virgin, was of full size, richly dressed in dark silks, and carried in a handsome Sedan; Other processions took place during  the evening; but I did not see all of them. This is a beautiful town of several thousand inhabitants; the houses are improving, are much neater, larger, and the people becoming much more refined and civilized than many of those before passed; Western Mexico, is well known to be the most refined and civilized portion of that country. We were much pleased with the decided improvement of whitewashing and other displays of taste in this place.No 74. is a hasty sketch of Eastlan and its surrounding mountains. The valley in which it is situated, descends gradually westward towards the Pacific Ocean; and is under good cultivation with pleasant Ranchos', several small villages &c. [*April 7th*] Day warm and clear; with an afternoon breeze from the  Pacific. Commenced our march at sun rise; and proceeded along the meanderings of a pleasant creek; that traversed this interesting valley. A few miles west of Eastlan we passed through a town of considerable size, within which there was a handsome shaded plaza, with a large, curious, and antiquated church. This town was also much shaded by Bannana and Orange groves and a greater part of the houses were very genteel. Here some of our company obtained excellent cups of chocolate &c. Many kinds of fruit were likewise abundant in this place. By the way, as we have before frequently seen, were erected several small shrines of some 8 or 10 feet square, in each of which was suspended the  cross, and around which were wreaths of roses, natural and artificial, with candles partly burned, and other things belonging to their religious ceremonies. These with lone cross's are to be seen plentifully throughoutMexico, and either mark a place of worship, or the spot where some individual has [been] met with an untimely  end. Proceeding down this pleasant valley and winding around various spurs of the wild mountains, that  rear'd their rugged heads upon either side of us, we at 15 miles from Eastlan opened upon a view as in No. 75, with the appearance of a volcano to the right hand. The creek that before travelled rapidly a rocky bed, now joined with other water courses in passing through a ravine or narrow channel of great debth. We now passed over immense fields of wildest volcanic rocks that at some period had been partly fused, and thrown up in rugged masses exceeding any description; extending thus for many miles west and North. The appearance of the rocks was quite black; in places quite spongy, and resembling somewhat the heavy spray of a wild Ocean storm, thrown up in massive peaks, and pinacles, that were at  once suddenly petrified or cooled into black rocky masses of half fused granite &c. Such a field of forrest peaks and black [Schorae ?], I have never before witnessed. The government of Mexico, have cut and paved a road through this lava country at great expense, labor and time.The particulars of which they have taken care to place  upon a pedestial by the way side; whereas by passing the road (such as it was) around a few miles to the left  they might have avoided the worst peaks and ridges  of the [Schorae ?]. Some scrubb oaks high pentangular cactus,  Etc shaded the Lava road in places, until we came out upon  barren hills. No 76 shows a hasty sketch of a part of the  lava fields on our way, looking back Southeast. About  this valley, which have spread out to many miles,  many little Ranchos and villages were to be seen upon  the fertile spots, like favored places upon the  desert of Arabia. The mountains around were exceedingly  wild, and only a few of them even sparsely timbered by a  dwarfish growth, of scrubb oaks, pines, and wild cactus. This broad triangular cove or great valley, was traversed  in every direction by hills, between which were small and  fertile coves, passes, and ravines, along which only the villages  and Ranchos were located. During this afternoon we passed through several pretty villages, that were snugly hid  away in these little vallies, and after passing over   a number of rolling hills, we ascended a mountain  to the north, where we encamped at Rancho Ocott.a few hundred yards from this rancho I sketched scene No 77. looking back Southward upon that great valley of vallies, over which we had just passed; from a height of about two thousand feet. I then passed on up the road 2 miles with a friend, and from a height looking into a vast ravine of perhaps 8 or 10 hundred feet, I sketched scene No 78. looking South west. Showing two great mountains rising in a part of the valley before named; a large stream of water was leaping and bounding off from cliff to cliff down this immense ravine, the sound of which could be heard a considerable distance; whilst it was closely shaded by tall timbers, that rose up the steep sides of the abyss, near to its summet edge. During this day we have seen back in the valley several fine falls of water from 5 to 60 or 70 feet, very suitable for mills but not improved. Along this deep ravine there are fine locations for such purposes. From this place Northward the timber for many miles became very large and plentiful; with large Oaks and pines in particular. During this afternoon Mr Slaight and Mr Jones two of our company were misled upon the wrong track, which caused some fears as to their safety, but both came into camp just  before dark.It is highly important that companies should keep compact whilst crossing the Mountains of Mexico, as those who stray off, are liable to be cut off by those who constantly watch such opportunities in the  trail of the large parties who may cross their country  April 8th  Day warm and clear. During this night individuals well known, left our camp by night, and proceeded forward at full speed, 16 leagues to Tepec, in advance of our train, in order to Secure passage up to california for themselves exclusive of our company should there not be room for all. This was showing their nature horns and all, for which they afterwards doubtless sorely repented, as certain of them had before promised to remain by each other through to California. The remainder of our company proceeded as usual not at all pleased with the rush for passage, almost every Mexican  returning; when asked, gave us different reports about the chances of passenger from San Blass up to San Francisco; and we could ascertain nothing very definite and but little that was encouraging. Some telling us that there was but one vessel in port which could take but four or five more passengers and prices very high, with poor accommodations; others,that there were several vessels in port, and others that there were none that could carry more passengers, and thus the reports varied, but the remainder of us thought best to take things coolly and as they might come; which afterwards proved to be to our especial advantage at Mazatlan. Proceeding northward on the Summet of the mountain on  which we had just encamped, we passed through much large and valuable oak timber. During the morning, I  sketched No 79. which includes Norelio Mountain, as seen  at the distance of about 10 miles to the northward, being also within full view of the town of Tepec to which we were bound. About an hour after sketching the former, we commenced descending a graded road down the mountain,  a part of which I sketched as in No 80. after which we  crossed a fine creek, then passed over and around a number of wild hills with but few scattering habitations, and those of the poorest kind until we came out upon the open woodless hills, that were beautifully rounded and moulded as by art, and only covered by parched prairie grass, and  ranging thus at random around the base of the great Novelio Mountain, whilst sloping off gently in an extensive valley, which was walled in on the North, East, and South by formidable mountains.Again, we ascended a small ridge, which soon gave us a fine view of the great valley of Tepec. We continued descending for Some time upon rolling hills, very sparcely timber with here and there patches of Scrubb oaks, cactus, etc. within about 6 miles of Tepec. I took sketch No. 81. [showing] showing the appearance of the country around that beautiful town. And before entering the town within about a mile and a half I took sketch No 82. showing a fine Stonebridge plastered, and of neat construction; on the principal road to Tepec. This road is generally broad, though not agreeable for [?] vehicles of any kind and is likewise well supplied with fine dust, which during (this) the dry season is almost intolerable during a windy afternoon. Our company arrived in Tepec at 3.O. clock. P.M. a band of dusty travellers, with long beards, jaded, and all the usual et ceteras that attend such a long journey and more especially in Mexico, but not yet closing our journey through this peculiar country. On arriving we ascertained that those preceding us to Tepec had engaged passage up to San Francisco upon a schooner of about 30 tons, that was said to be unfit for service. They paying 70 dollars, and find themselvesbesides being compelled to sleep upon deck; and even at that thinking themselves lucky in getting the chance, at the same time chuckling at us, whoom they considered unfortunate; in not having a chance to sail from San Blass, and at the same time telling us that they pittied us, as we must evidently remain somewheres in Mexico possibly for months to come. But believing that from the greater importance of Mazatlan as a sea port, and place of business, we concluded after resting a day in Tepec to proceed thither, although it was yet another week's journey, the result of which will be seen greatly to our advantage. April 9th  Day warm and clear. In company with a friend (Mr. Sayre), I proceeded this morning at an early hour, several miles out of town upon the summet of a neighboring mountain; (it being a day rest for our animals &c) from the heights of which, an extensive and most beautiful view opened in every direction To the east we saw the lofty peaks of Novelio mountain, and very many of those pretty woodless, and grass covered egg shaped hills before mentioned. Far beyond which formidable mountains reared their misty shadows in dim outline high upon the horizon, upon which the morning's sun had already arissen in his glory amid flitting clouds. The South, thesome great chain of mountains ranged with their many lofty peaks; South west a beautiful valley continued for miles,  with a high mountain ranging west of it. The same mountain  approaching to within a mile of our peak, fell off abruptly  and a valley turned around at right angles with the  former, ranging off into red hills, towards the Pacific Ocean. An extensive and magnificent view broke upon us from  the North, which I endeavored to sketch as in No. 83. North East were seen mountains and peaks piled upon  mountains, many of which were seen far above the mists  and detached clouds of the morning. Here the country  descends rapidly upon the Pacific plains, which are  nearly two days journey from Tepec. The plains could  be seen far on the dim horizon but not the Ocean. This scene was extensive and grand beyond description. To the north and several hundred feet below us, there was  a circular lake of water, No. 84. partly covered with  green rushes, and edged by high walls of rocks, being rugged  bluffs of dark brown rocks, in places covered with a red soil. This lake was nearly round, and elevated several  hundred feet above the valley of Tepec, and exhibited  all the signs of having been at some period a vastcrater to this volcanic country, but now filled up  with water. We then descended into a deep ravine, at the  foot of the hill (letter A) No 84. Through which a fine large stream  water descended rapidly upon a rocky bed. Near the foot  of hill A. is located an extensive cotton factory belonging to Mess  Forbes & Co. as in sketch No 85 .and sketch No 86. taking  two different views of this handsome establishment. The proprietors I believe are Englishmen. Their garden  of Bannanas, Plantains, Oranges and other tropical fruits, is extensive, and exceedingly beautiful, and  more to the idea of some Hindoo scene than one in Mexico. The whole scenery about this factory is  pretty, tasty and romantic. This establishment does  an extensive business. We returned to town by 2.O. clock P.M. after which I sketched the interior of our  Mason (No 87.) or public house, which was tastefull constructed;  our quarters however were not as agreeable as the  appearance of the place. The church on the plaza was large  but of an ordinary appearance, and another similar one  in the town, but a very handsome one of smaller dimensions  1 1/2 miles from the plaza, which time would not  permit me to sketch, and attend to other duties.A hasty sketch of the plaza was also taken as in No 88. It was surrounded by large shade trees of the oak; and in the centre of it there was a pretty fountain of a plain but neat appearance. The plaza was almost entirely surrounded by colonade rows of usually two Story Stores of the first class. The streets of the town ran uniformly at right angles; were clean, and well paved; the same at Gaudalaxhara, the towns of Logos, and San Louis Potosi, etc. The rooves of the houses were uniformly flat, generally one story in height, frequently whitewashed, or neatly ornamented with various colors. But the suburbs of the town, as usual for Mexico, was surrounded by small mud cabins which so much destroys the good effects of Scenery about the Mexican towns, villages, Rancho's etc. At Tepec, we met another American party, and here also 10 of our company left us in order to proceed a distance of 60 miles to San Blass, and from thence embark upon a vessel they had never seen, which afterwards proved to be unseaworthy and landed them some 9 or 10 days afterwards at Mazatlan in (distress and other) difficultiesWe had remonstrated with them however at Tepec, and there they considered their chances much superior to ours. [*April 10th*]  Day warm and clear. Left Tepec at an early hour, and proceeded through a northwest pass, among red hills, little coves, and small narrow and fertile vallies among Shady groves, palms, Bannanas, Plantains, Oranges, &c. and when plenty of watermellons could be  obtained very cheap with other fruits, this region of the country appeared well setled with neat and Shady Ranches, and well supplied with running streams of water. Many farms here appeared like little paradis's for shade romance, and the comforts of life; and many were the  varied scenes of this [day] morning that were really captivating. [except] But in the after part of the day upon the planes, having descended upon a warmer country, we were  open more to the sun, and much annoyed by dust. In making our grand descent upon the plains, we passed down over a long rotine of rugged hills, that gradually diminished as we descended, being sparcely covered with large Palm trees, some underbrush, and now and then parched, prarie grass not of much interest. The view however on descending was extensive, as in sketch No 89.Having descended upon the Pacific Plains, we were  again in a much warmer climate. We again passed from the dull monotony of timbers upon the mountains when such may be found, to a lower country where a large variety were daily presented to our notice. We now saw Palms in great abundance, large oaks, the Banyan, Beach, some cedar, large cotton bearing trees, tropical fruit trees plentifully, with many whose species were unknown to us. We passed several small villages on the planes, and a number of Ranchos. Enormous trees of a species with which I am not familiar, but resembling the mulberry somewhat in shape  and leaf, and in other respects the Beach tree, grows by the road side in many places, and being dense for spreading and of very great magnitude, it frequently gave us an acceptable shade; during our travels across the planes. These five large shade trees, are however not too abundant, and by seeing them in the distance I frequently judged our distance from a Rancho; as they are favorite trees on these planes. This afternoon we crossed two almost dry beds of wheat when flush were called rivers, but not of great magnitudeOn this days route fruits, Mellons, etc, were plentiful and cheap. 16 Bannanas for 6 1/4 cts or a Madeau, A fair water mellon for a Madeau (6 1/4 cts) 1 madeau for a dish of beans stew'd with some meat. 1 madeau for 3 boiled eggs, and 1 madeau for 4 or 6 tortelias or corn cakes; As we had found it on the other side of the Cordilleres, we also experienced here; high prices in Scarce and barren places, and cheap things where the soil was good, well settled, and fruit groves, etc, consequently to be found. About 3 O. clock P.M. our train halted for the night at a Rancho 33 miles N west of Tepec which I sketched as in No 90. The water of a neighboring creek being warm, a part of our company were in to bathe. During this night Mr Davis (who joined us some days back) was scalded by the accidental overturning of our large camp kettle, in which was stewing a fine mess of chicken, supposed to have been done by wolves, that were heard about just before I was on duty as one of the Sentinels from 12 to 2 and several times, heard the wolves, Mr D was not badly scalded however. [*April 11th*]  Day clear and hot. Commenced our march at an early hour, and soon forded a broad and very rocky creek, and during the morning passed through several acceptable woodland groves.Passed a number of ranchos where fruits &c. were plenty and cheap; and the country now generally quite levil. About noon, we came upon the broad sandy beach of a river. Our saddles, baggage, &c. was conveyed across in small boats, (canoes) whilst the whole drove of our animals swam the river together. The scene was  interesting and having a few moments (after just finishing a fine large water mellon) I sat down and  sketched the river, Mountains, &c., as in View No 91. The mountains were still in view; and follow upon our right, all the way to Mazatlan, as we are now persuing our way up the coast, though not yet in Sight of the Pacific Ocean. This river which we have just now crossed (I was told) is called the \"Rio San Diago\", being about 18 Mexican leagues from Tepec, or something over 50 miles. Having crossed the River, whilst the mules was reloading &c. for our further progress, most of our company went into a town nearby (of some size) and refreshed themselves upon fruits, coffee, chocolate, eggs, &c. etc. The town though of good size, was dilapidated and of an ordinary appearance, though commanding apretty location. Persuing our course over a very dusty road that wound hither and thither upon a levil country of brushwood and larger clusters of timber, we passed through a village of perhaps 40 or more houses, all entirely deserted, except one, which was tennanted by one Solitary man of a fierce countenance, being a cripple, who had only a few poor mellons for sale at high rates. This was rather strange yet strangely true, one man the Sole lord of a desolate village, no other Mexican was seen in the whole place, and all was closed up without Signs of furniture; the place may have fell into the hands of Robbers, or be unhealthy; we did not ask respecting it of the man, although it excited remarks in our company. This afternoon afforded but little of interest except some large cotton fields, with ripe cotton, belonging to some Ranchos, and surrounded by fences, which is an uncommon thing in this country, fences are very  rare throughout all Mexico. we travelled many hundred miles without even seeing a fence; although there may be many farms, it is not every man that has a fence, and even those who posess them mostly have very short appologies for fences, which  are rare things in Mexico,I mean fences of wood stone fences of great length, have been seen almost every day or two, amongst the settled parts of the mountains. To day we saw, as beforementioned, fine fields of cotton; but for the first time that I remember in Mexico. We also saw a wild tree about the size and shape of an ordinary apple tree, bearing large and numerous pods of the fine white cotton; And a number of curious fruit trees about the woodlands and water courses. Much of this days travels, all things considered is not by any means inviting to travellers; being dusty in places open to the hot sun, and much of the time rather uncivilized in appearance, which however is no criterion to judge western Mexico by. Before sunset we halted, after a long days march at the Rancho of \"Buena Vista\" being about 145 miles from Mazatlan. I sketched this place as in No 92. A friend Mr Custer, and I went out afar the creak near by for game, and we returned in about 15 minutes with 3 large Pheasants upon which we made a fine supper, and obtained plenty more for our breakfast, and to carry with us for our dinner, our company numbering at this time between 25 and 30. Since leaving Tepec, those for San Blass taking  another road.[*April Thorsd 12th*] Left our Rancho at an early hour. Day clear and hot; with the usual afternoon winds from the Pacific. Passed over an extensive palm country this day, gentle slopes all day covered sparcely with tall and scattered Palm trees, grass burnt off for miles in places; much wild game by the way, few habitations, and those generally of the lowest class. In the morning sketched No 93. of the lofty peaks &c. of the  Cordilleres on our night, which are always in full view in passing up the coast . About noon we again came  to the bank of another River which was partly dry, and at this season fordable, I did not ask its name, but the town of Cauponetta , was on the opposite side to which we forded. A number of Mexican women were along the margin of this river at their customary employment of  washing out clothing; one very clear trait of the Mexicans. Sketch No 94. shows, the river, town, and mountain scenery from opposite Cauponette Puebla. After refreshing  ourselves upon mellons, fruit, etc, in this pleasant town we proceeded forward at a rapid gait to finish a long days march. Much of our road was very dusty, though there was less wind than usual; our country slightly rolling and upon the night a full view of the lofty mountains of the coast.This night we encamped at a desolate Rancho a few miles beyond a river, where things had a distressing appearance we could neither obtain water or food of any importance at this place, so that most of us had neither supper nor breakfast. The appearance of everything about these few huts, was perfectly squallid, and the natives almost totally unclothed and appearing reckless and unconcerned about any thing. We camped beside the road, and huts, and kept strict watch during the night; but a few miles back, on the other side of the river we could have encamped at a small village, where all the conveniences were at hand, but being only a few days from Mazatlan, our company became very anxious to finish their land travels in Mexico, and consequently pressed each day. We missed it, decidedly in crossing the river this night, as we left a pleasant camp grove and conveniences at that place, for a desolate place where we lost two meals, and had no water either for our animals or ourselves  April 13th  Day warm and clear with a fine seabreeze this afternoon Passed through a nearly level country, covered with scattering palms; we came to a village of a squallid appearance about 10. O.clock A.M. where by much trouble we made out to get something to  eat.of all squallid places we had yet seen, this village was the climax. Here in front of a cabin, sat a wretched looking woman clothed in rags, and her feet projecting on the walk from a heavy pair of wooden stocks, where she was fastened probably for some offence. The whole of the inhabitants were almost entirely unclothed and appeared to be living in misery and starvation. Having the bold mountains on our right which were all day in full view, we proceeded onward up the coast through Palm forrests, that seem'd never ending, and towards noon oppressively hot; several crosses were passed this day; whilst this section of the country appeared very much uncivilized; and we frequently met men, entirely without clothing. A range of mountains seem'd now to range off west to the Pacific Ocean, over which it appeared that we must pass, on the morrow; approaching within a few miles of their wild and rugged base, we encamped at a Rancho called Cerauso, as in Sketch No 95. here things appeared more genteel than on the previous night and we were enabled to purchase a scanty allowance of provisions, which were in demand and highly acceptable.April 14th Day clear and hot, Left our rancho at an early hour, and proceeded along the base of rugged mountains directly west to within some 5 or 6 miles of the Pacific beach, but not in sight of the ocean, as we came upon a low ground, we passed around the end of those mountains, and travelled over flat planes covered with high grass, and in places pools of Salt water, and yet on this day we did not see the ocean, although at one time we were said to be quite near to the beach. from the edge of a Small Salt lake, I sketched some large and high rocks, which were the terminus of the mountains and nearest to the ocean as in No. 96. I had no time to ascend it, or I may have possibly first beheld the Pacific from its Summet. Again we appeared to direct our course inward from the coast, which brought us in the afternoon to a broad river, with wide beaches of sand and gravel. This stream we forded and entered the pleasant town of Rosario as in sketch No. 97. The location of this town with its mountain scenery was very pretty and interesting. Fruits of every kind with fine mellons were very abundant and cheap in this place. The churchwas large, antiquated, but of handsome finish; up the river about two miles and upon the opposite side, there appeared in full view a similar building of great magnitude, and from its colors and peculiar structure appearing to be much superior to the building in Rosario. Mountains of great magnitude were from 5 to 10 miles to the eastward. In the afternoon we left this pleasant and populous town, and persuing our way among gently rolling hills Palm groves, and vast tracts of brushy oaks, Bodock trees & we encamped at a village of a genteel but  odd appearance; where provisions were plenty, and cheap, and the inhabitants quite friendly. Oranges, mellons &c plentiful. April. 15th  Day clear and hot, persued our course at an early hour, travelling the same routine of plains, rolling grounds, gullies, Palm forrests, &c this day we passed through many miles of Bodock trees, which much resembled an orchard of civilization, extending, far beyond the reach of the eye, with many thousands of bushels of large Bodock apples; I have no doubt but that in time, the seed of these trees will be sought after  for making hedge fences over countries where timber may be scarce. At noon we passed through a fine large townand stopped for a time to refresh ourselves at the market plazas; immense quantities of watermellons were seen in every direction; Soon a large congregation of Ladies, Gentlemen, and civilized looking people came pouring forth from a  large and antiquated church upon the plaza; and people quietly on their way to their houses, though viewing our company with some little surprise and attention. From this town we persued our way over \"slightly rolling\" country of Palms, oaks, and in places a variety of timbers and encamped at night as usual at a rancho. April. 16th Day clear and hot. Persued our journey at an early hour being in full view of Mountains all day, sometimes among hills, and at others upon plains of Palms or extensive groupes of underbrush, with scattering trees of magnitude. The mountain Scene No 98. was sketched this afternoon, from the summet of a Small hill. during the day we passed over several open praries and at night encamped at a rancho of a respectabe appearance beside a fine stream of good water. April 17th Day clear and hot. Persued our journey at Sunrise in order to reach Mazatlan this day. During themorning our road wound considerably amongst small hills, and was sparcely timbered with some Palms, Oaks, &c during the whole day, except where Salt lakes had left level planes of Sand, with not even vegetation Sometimes for miles in some directions upon one of these sand beds, I witnessed to day, what is called mirage, or the deception of water, ahead. For some time I supposed that we were coming to the margin of a lake whose waters were troubled into waves by wind, but on approaching the same, I discovered the mistake; by discovering that the heat of the Sun caused a mist to arise from the sand, which by its position and  reflection to the eye caused the deception called mirage. about noon we arrived in the old village of Mazatlan distant from the present Sea port of Mazatlan, about 24  miles. At present it is a place no importance, and is much dilapidated; we obtained some fruit here and proceeded on our journey to the port of Mazatlan, before leaving this place I sketched the ruins of an ancient church at one corner of the old village Square as in Sketch No 99. Shortly after leaving this place we forded a river, and persued our course over a level ground towards the Pacific OceanSketch No 100. was taken 15 miles from the Port of Mazatlan. Those hills on its back ground are along the Pacific, and several of them stand out in the Ocean. The foreground is a Sandy plain, on which at w, I thought I saw the lake of water, which as I was very thirsty at the time, appeared quite acceptable, and after taking the sketch, I dashed away full speed with my horse, to reach it with the company, but it proved to be a very complete deception of water. Approaching within 8 miles of the Pacific, we came to the bank of a Salt lake, which I sketched as in No 101. showing the distant hills near the port of Mazatlan. At 6 miles I took another sketch as in No 102. whilst we were passing around the Salt lake. The fresh breeze was fanning us from the pacific; the declining Sun was shedding his gentler evening rays upon us from over the hills of the Port of Mazatlan, as we wound our way around that pretty lake before named, and crossing the flats, we arising suddenly upon a high ground came at once in full view of the long sought for port of Mazatlan, and for the first time a broad and beautiful view of the Pacific Ocean, its islands, shipping, and its foaming  surfs that chased each other rapidly upon the pretty beach before us. What a captivating view; two great objects at one view, the Pacific, and the port of Mazatlan  with also the gratification of now closing our land,  journey across Mexico, and again embarking upon the  mighty waters of the Ocean; and thus ending the second great chapter after leaving Philadelphia, and about to  enter now upon a third important change. All  the past toils were passed over without a murmur, when arriving here, none would of course return by the same way should such ever offer, but none were sorry that they had encountered the toils and fatigues of this journey when they knew it had now closed by land, and was about to commence by Sea; and all were of course well pleased and quite merry on entering the town with their prospects of soon being at Sea; and done with Mexico."

    "paragraph": "Having been some time impressed with the belief that a trip to California would be beneficial not only in a pecuniary point of view, but likewise to the better regulation of health and future happenings, I resolved about the 1st of January of 1849 to have my profession that of a Mathematical Instrument Maker and the eve to be remembered Monumental city of Baltimore for a trip to the golden shores of the far western El Dorado. Circumstances favoring, I made preparations in Philadelphia presuming that my trip thither would be made by sea around Cape Horn a distance of 7000 miles in the Ship \"Mason\" which advertised to leave that port several times fixing definite days of departure. Mr W.H. Ogden called upon me requesting my naming in forming a company then to be limited to 10 or 15 select gentlemen. I consented and gave my name as one of the party them numbering three, whose names were W. H. Ogden, B Jay Antrim and W Middleton, the latter of whom had since resigned and remained at his residence in New Jersey. Mr Ogden and myself drew up a notice at Mr Bonsals' Book Store, at No 33 1/2 Market Street, Philadelphia and inserted the same in the \"Ledger,\" and \"North American.\" The advertisment requesting all desirous of making a speedy and an agreeable journey via Matamoras, Monterey, Saltileo, Durango and Mazatlan to California to address \"Camargo,\" at the office's of those two respective papers, which was soon followed by a number of applicants; who were severally visited by Mr Ogden and myself. Mr Jones, of 6th Street, being the first of that number added to our list. We soon procured a room for meeting at No 100 Chestnut Street through the kindness Majors Collins and Ross, where we met in harmony and concert of action until we had completed our company and extended the number of the same to Forty. At one of the Meetings, the name of \"Camargo Company\" was adopted, which is the name of a Mexican town, to which we were first destined from Philadelphia, by sea, and from thence after having procured there our outfit of mules provissions & to proceed overland to Mazatlan via the abovementioned route. Old resolutions adopted in our \"Camargo\" meetings limiting our numbers were several times rescinded and new ones were adopted until our number had increased to forty as before mentioned & Committees of Camp Equipage, provissions, pasports, protections, for chartering a vessel &c all of whoom acted and reported accordingly. Having ascertained that the abovenamed route was infested with hoards of warlike and savage Camanchee Indians, who were committing outrages and massacring those found in their way, and that the same route was in consequence very dangerous, and believing it rash, as also influenced by friends, I withdrew my name from that route, and proposed the Tampico route to the company as the safest, most pleasant, and a shorter land distance than the former; which then being unfavorably received, I withdrew by advice, and my own impressions of that course, and then prepared to proceed around by Cape Horn. In the mien time, the company adopted the Tampico route via San Louis Potosi &c. and —Mr. Ogden called upon me to inform me of it and his desire with many of my old friends was that I should return to the company: and as they had changed the rout to the one I thought most prefferable, I again added my name. Mr Ogden was elected President and myself Secretary of the \"Camargo Company,\" and in my leaving Mr W Robinson, merchant, was elected to supply my place, in which by request and his absence I served several times after my return. A committee appointed chartered the Brig \"Thomas Walters,\" to convey our company of forty to Tampico in Mexico, which was contracted for at $50.00 each, for cabin passage, and the vessel advertised to sail at 8 O Clock A.M. on the 31st of January 1849. Four members declined going with us and three others filled their vacancies. In consequence of some difficulty in entering our articles at the custom house for Mexico, whereby our Captain and vessel was in danger of the laws of Mexico, - our departure was delayed until 9.0.clock A.M. on the following morning the 1st of February. Feb 1st Slight Snow, cold and finally sleety rain; I repaired with all remains of baggage to the vessel at an early hour, and found many congregated to witness our departure. The crowds along the wharves notwithstanding the inclemency of the weather, continued to increase until many hundreds lined the surrounding piers. A few minutes before 9.0.clock our company repaired with arms to two lines upon the Quarter Deck, and fired from guns and pistols a departing salute. Mr Robinson then presented - \"three cheers to our Country\", which our company responded to with warmth - \"three cheers to the friends and dear bonnie lassies, we leave behind,\" and it burst simultaneously from the very hearts of all. - and \"three cheers to Philadelphia\" which we answered appropriately according with our sentiments of the Quaker City. The citizens upon the wharves responded - \"three cheers for the success of the Carmago Company\" followed by a succession of cheers for individuals named in our company, among which the clerk of the Ship \"Mason,\" observing my singular dress in common with my comrades and knowing me, gave \"three cheers for the Buckskin Injnn.\" and thus did our friends cheer us at the hour of separating from all that was dear to us, to embark upon the great and eventful Ocean of future prospects. About, 9.0.clock A.M. the steamboat \"Wave' came beside and before night towed us in co with another vessel as far as New Castle. At New Castle we dropped anchor for the night, and finding a mistake of six packages of provisions which were nescessary for the completion of the captains' manifest for Mexico, it was found requisite to send Mr Thompson, immediately back to Philadelphia in order to bring on the same by express, which he did by an early hour on the following morning, and received a vote of thanks from the company. This evening was spent with considerable spirit and mirth on the part of Messrs Robinson, C. Jones and Bates; which however was excused by the company in general as they were known to be gentleman, and believed to be unaccustomed to such heavy exercises. Besides the leaving of home under the deepest immaginable of melancholly feelings. This day a vote was taken in the affirmative for prohibiting the smoking of cigars in either cabin of the Brig, the quantity of powder and combustibles on board beeing deem'd a sufficient reason. The Roll was called and the following gentlemen answered to their names, --  to wit. Some of our company went on shore at New Castle and made some few purchases of small articles. Have up anchor at an early hour, and got under way towards the breakwater. weather cold and hazy. Proceeded but a short distance this day and cast anchor 2 miles below Reedy Island, in the afternoon where we remained until 4.0.clock the next morning. Weather clear and cold with a North West wind which drove us out the bay in a beautiful and interesting manner with full canvass on a bounding sea. Personal feelings were consulted over the guard in a member of cases, and after, relief expressed. My feelings were much agitated in consequence of the heavy ocean [swells], and I left an elegant dinner of soup and chickens to contemplate the foamingbillows, and returned when convenient to finish the same, which I did in a few minutes with more relish after having cast over a full account much to the relief of my inexpressible feelings. The dinner table was left patronized by our gents than on the day previous, who were also contemplating the foaming billows with the same inexpressible feelings. One instance of inebriation occurred this day which created unpleasant feelings between the captain and said individual, but was amicably settled to the benefit of said person and any of the company, should they in future indulge, which it is presumed they will not doo, as many if not nearly the whole of them, appear to be temperate and sensible men. This evening being much moderated, with a clear and beautiful Moon, most of our party promenade the whole round of the vessel in rapid Military order, whilst the brig bounded upon the long and high Ocean Swells with that majesty becomming the bread bosom of the Atlantic; whilst the spray threw up to the bowsprit and the sheeted sides, it's showery foam, gilded by the silvery rags of the Moon, and followed in the wake  by a long bright trail of foaming ripples receding in our pathway back to the horizon.Our boat dashed on handsomely to the tune of a brisk wind, whilst the music and merry songs of the happier ones arose in concert with the gently whistling winds that playfully tuned their ocean song amid our rigging and canvass. The whole scene was exceedingly  interesting, and the music harmonious,  being sung by good voices, well timed, and filled with the deepest base voice, for a human being that I ever heard, which added greatly to the sweetness of the music; they sang numerous songs that had more richness amid a scene like this, than I had ever before supposed could be the case; I enjoyed it very much. Harmony and quietness prevail generally throughout the cabins, and no discords have occurred this day. A clear, mild, and beautiful morning. I rose early in order to behold the Sun rise over the ocean, which was beautifully decorated  with long light clouds, which partly shaded its disk and gave more glowing colors to the scene; At 10. A.M. a meeting for worship,was called on the after dark, and Revd Mr. Woods,  officiated, assisted by the Revd Mr Blake, nearly each  member attend the meeting; which was conducted  with very creditible solemnity and attention. The  subject was to those who go down upon the great  deep, with a copy of an address delivered by a Revd  gentleman to the young gentleman of Boston, on emigrating  to California, and the choice of good society. A pistol exploded from firing last night, and Mr. Robinson  was cut back of the right shoulder by a piece  at least 5 inches in length, the would though sore  to stay is not however dangerous. This afternoon  many guns and pistols were fired at the little  dog sharks, that are now following our vessel in  numbers; 7 or 8 of which were caught and hauled  on board with fish hooks and lines; they were  usually two feet in length, and bore some resemblance  to the common pike. This afternoon we have  made but little progress, owing to a calm, and  have hardly average 2 knots an hour for half the day,  Towards night clouds arose with sprinkling rain  and there was a general disposition to be in doors. Monday 5th - Up before sunrise and saw the sparkling ocean spray as our galliant boat drove swiftly o'er mountain waves before a fierce gale which changed to a storm by noon, a day long to be remembered by many of our sea sick company. Such a sight all over the Brig, it only kneeds  an old sea faring man to judge of over 30 green ones just ushered to sea in a fierce gale with rain pelting them like so much fine shot; and they bounding sky high on mountain billows. The bounding of our vessel was truly majestic and far beyond what I had ever before witnessed; all sails were tied up and nothing but the small stay sail open to the gale during the afternoon Nearly the whole company were sick, including myself, but I did not so much as loose one meal by it. I soon had an apetite, which was also  the case with many others; few however were at dinner this day. Upon the whole it was a day of miserable sickening, storm, gales and long billows many of which were full 25 feet in perpendicular height.clouds, rain, howling winds and high sea raged all day Tues 6th Beautiful clear morning, after a terrible night of high winds and high billows. To day the ocean moved in immense swells like small hills, with yawning vallies between, but the morning was clear, and the air mild and further fire unescessary. Our stove being upset this morning we did not rectify it, nor feel the need of it. The sick ones are improving and getting lively; the vessel has bounded on beautifully all day, and we crossed the Gulf Stream this morning, winds from the west which drove us out to sea, possibly 350 miles from land, and this evening a little south of the lattitude of Charleston of South Carolina. Saw one sail to the west this morning. Light clouds in the afternoon, and pleasant moonlight evening, with the sea and winds pretty high. Company merry on deck, & Saw one porpose, 5 or 6 nautilus, and gulf weed this morning all interesting to one looking for a subject. It should have been mentioned that Mr. Hewes, one of our company, lost his belt overboard yesterday containing two hundred and twenty five dollars in gold.Wednesday 7th A cloudy morning, high winds and mountain billows; air cool and winds mostly from the west. We bounded on bravely all this day o'er the foaming sea, realing too and fro, with our deck at times almost at an angle of 45, both side ways and lengthwise. The dishes on the dinner table partook likewise of the general commotion. This whole day was another of swift winds, amounting almost to a gale, which stirred up the billious temperaments of our company as usual, and there were many sick ones about deck again as usual. At 12, at noon, we passed a sail in the distance and at 1.0.clock P.M. another to which we hoisted a red flag with red star upon a square white ground, which they answered with the American flag; the winds and the ocean being  to high to speak them. They were bound to the States. We passed them in about Latitude 32 and about 400 miles out to sea from South Carolina. At night the moon rose amid flying clouds, but the air was so cool, the wind so high, and our deck so much wet by the spray from theangry mountaneous ocean, that few remained on deck long; the berths being prefferable. It is not an uncommon thing to hear one or two fall out of their berths, upon the floor, and to observe a general scrambling of boots, hats, trunks, &c for a downhill race to the opposite sides of the cabin whilst cradling upon the high blue  ribs of the ocean. Then occasionally springing a breeze. Thursd 8th Light clouds, air mild, and a pleasant breeze from the North East, with light ocean waves. Held a meeting on financial arrangements on the Quarterdeck at 10.A.M. Saw a ship ahead this morning bound southward in Latitude 29° 40,\" about 400 miles out to sea. Fine sunny day with bland breezes and very light ocean swells. Nearly all of our company are amusing themselves about decks variously. Catching sea weeds, and fifty other little time killing amusements. At 4 O.clock P.M. we held a meeting on the Quarterdeck during which time we elected Mr. Grant, our Captain, for the trip over Mexico to Mazatlan. Mr. McCrellish, 1st Lieutenant, Mr. Hughes, 2nd do Mr. W. H. Ogden the Quarter Master, and Mr. Thompson, the Commissary. It being understood that we go through during our voyage, a regular Military drilling in order to fit us for cases of insurgency in our Mexican Campaign. A pleasant moonlight evening, air mild, with a brisk breeze, and sailing about 10 Knots the hour. Friday 9th A beautiful morning of pleasant breezes; up early and saw the sun rise clear upon the rolling ocean. We sailed beautifully all day with a fine breeze. Things passed off pleasantly and merrily all day, with a mild and elegant moonlight evening; set up until 11.O.clock, hearing and telling wonderful things, which were magic charms, when told by moonlight on so mild and exquisite evening as this, added the gentle undulations of the sea, the fountains of spray, and the bland Zephyrs of the South. Saw a number of white flying fish during this afternoon, which were beautiful and attractive. Sat 10th A clear, warm, and calm morning, sun even getting hot Near, but not in sight of the West Indies. No wind and almost quiet; Ocean almost quiet; This day proved to be a regular calm, and the sun very warm. Coats and vests off, and hardly a breeze. We do not appear to have moved 15 miles all day. A breeze sprung up in the evening and got us under headway at about 5 knots, with a pleasant late moonlight night. A flying fish came on board this evening and was captured. All are well so far on the vessel. Sund 11th Morning warm, clear, and a brisk wind driving us at the rate of 10 knots towards the island with the \"hole in the wall\", but not in sight yet (11 A.M.) Came in sight of the Bahamia island at 1/2 past 11. A.M. but there being a high head wind, we lost all this afternoon and night in tacking too and from the land, with a high sea. Held a meeting  for worship this afternoon at 1/2 past 3.O.clock. Rev'd Mr. Woods delivered a powerful and highly eloquent appeal to our company, with a good effect. A request was sent to our Chaplain (elect) by several individuals, to their discredit, not to hold services on board; but it being overruled by a large majority, services were held as usual. Monday 12th Mild with high head winds, only about 10 miles gained by tacking the whole day. We were insight of the islands several times during the day. At night a black and angry storm rolled over us with rain and fierce winds raising huge billows, howling and tossing us fearfully about on the ocean all night. Silent fear reign'd in our company, but some hardened cases went so far as to make sport in the midst of this exciting scene. Tuesday 13th Passed the \"hole in the wall,\" with light house early this morning. The sun rose beautifully in a fleecy cloud of golden hue, and a brisk wind drove us rapidly towards the Bahamia Bar, the day is clear, mild, and our Brig passed 5 other vessels this morning all bound in the same direction. Arrived at the Bahamia Bar, at 12 Meridian, and crossed it during the afternoon and evening; The water on the Bar is from 15 to 40 feet generally, and sufficiently clear in most places to see bottom at 15 feet. The bottom appears to be composed of white sand, with here and there patches of sponge. The color of the water on the Bar for about 60  miles is a beautiful light Skye Blue, whilst that of the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico is of a darkand blue color. we passed Berry islands this morning and saw there, a number of small sailing craft, and some about a wrecked vessel. A colored gentleman has a very fine farm, and several wives upon one of these singular looking islands. A good breeze drove us on rapidly ahead of all other vessels. The day has been warm clear, and the sun set among gilded clouds showing us a scene exciting universal admiration. Such a glowing sun set scene, few of us have ever before witnessed even in midsummer. There is something exquisite, glowing, brilliant and more diversified with brilliant and unapproachable colors accompanying a sun set scene in this southern chime, that seldom occurs to those farther north, and infinitely above the Artists pencil. [*Wednesday 14th *] Temperature mild, high and favorable wind driving us rapidly to the South west over the gulf of Mexico. No land in sight this morning. Saw several hundred flying fish this afternoon; the vessel appeared to scare them out of the water. We travelled very rapidly all this day and night.[*Thursd 15th*] Morning clear and mild, with a strong breeze driving us rapidly ahead, no land in sight. The gulf is here of a bluish brown appearance and occasionally when the sun is in a certain position of a greenish cast. Our vessel is now dashing off spray and waves of white foam as though she were ploughing by steam. One of our company Mr Chevallier, fell  down our cabin stairs this morning, but was not seriously injured, though stunned by the (long) fall. [*Frid 16th*] Morning clear, warm, and a regular calm. We were lying still at sun rise, but a breeze sprung up during the morning which increased to a strong wind during the afternoon, and drove us forward quite rapidly. This day was warm and clear. Saw many flying fish as usual with some Nautilus, & the Gulf waters appear now nearly black. The spray is flying skye high o'er deck, and we are dashing onward within about 550 miles of Tampico. Cool, high head wind, rough sea and day generally  cloudy, a day of but little interest. Cool, wind from the North, a strong gale with some rain, sea very high and disagreeable. Saw large schools of Porpoises, at several different times playing about the bow of the vessel, flying fish abundant, with occasionally some curious sea birds. This whole day & night has been exceedingly boisterous and unpleasant. Mon.d 19th  Morning clear, air mild, fair wind and travelling pretty fair. The sick ones of yesterday are getting lively again. no land yet in sight. pleasant evening and travelling rapidly ahead. Tues.d 20th  Morning clear, mild, with fair wind and rapid travelling within 200 miles of Tampico. Wed.nd 21st  Warm and clear. Gulf in a calm. discovered  land at 1/2 past 12 P.M. a fair breeze in the afternoon water of the Gulf getting quite green. The coast of Mexico ranges in barren and here and there partly cultivated hills. very Singular scenery. The pilots came out to us at 4 P.M. and took us into Tampico by dark, being up a small and crooked river about 6 1/2 miles. Vegetation &c was all green and the Spring verdure was here in all its richness fully displayed. The breakers running upon the shore were quite interesting and our entranceto Tampico over the bar was quite favorable. The  county about Tampico is in flats and broken hope  and there into low rolling hills of a peculiar  appearance, covered here and there with dense Chaparell. An officer boarded our vessel and examined  our passports, and we anchored off Tampico in the  river Rio Paneuco. Many porposes were playing  in the gulf as we entered the river. it was a beautiful sun set scene, and the weather quite warm.  we were not permitted to go on shore this evening. We have now arrived in Mexico, 20 1/2 days from  the wharf in Philadelphia. Clear. & Warm like August. landed this morning  at 10.A.M. in Tampico. went to the city Plaza and  examined strange costoms, dress, appearances of things &c. wandered with friends about town and suburbs all  day except when our baggage passed the Custom  House, when we had all taken to private rooms  rented for our company. Our impressions of Tampico  and the Mexicans in general, was at first quite unfavorable,  but in a few days becoming more familiarized with their  very singular manners and appearances, we felt more at home Tampico. State of Tamaulipas. Mexico. 23rd For one Real or 12 1/2 cts in company with a friend I crossed the  Rio or river Paneuco, to the shore of the State of Vera Cruz, from which place I sketched Tampico, as per plate No. 1. To a citizen of the States unaccustomed to foreign life, it at once presents an oriental appearance. There are two plaza's or public squares in the city the principal one facing the  river and the other back, upon which two of the Military posts and a small plain cathedral are located. The streets run generally at right angles, and three fourths of the  houses are one story in height, without chimnies, window glass, boards, or brick; being usually constructed either of bamboo, mud, or stone, which are generally plastered upon the exterior surface, and occasionally painted. The roof of each principal dwelling generally partaking of the usual Mexican trait, though more Americanized than  most other Mexican cities. The suburbs are almost entirely composed of cabins of Bamboo, thatched with the leaves of  the palmetto. The city is located upon a slightly undulating ground and almost entirely surrounded by water. The many singular plants with the beautiful flowers and foliage of spring combined with the lively colors of the dwellings, gave to Tampico, a singular and highly interesting appearance. The mainplaza, is paved with limestone (vide sketch No 2.) in the centre of which there is a large circular pediment of limestone rising in 6 steps, upon the summet of which there was once a monument of Santa Anna; which has been destroyed in their Revolutionary events. The building marked No 1. belongs to the British government; it is a costly and handsome establishment, and is  the head quarters for the immense quantities of silver, brought from the mines of San Louis Polosi. The markets are held every morning upon a part of this plaza. It is inferior to those in the States, though more abundantly stocked with the tropical fruits, at much less prices. Beef, fowls, fish, eggs, cheese, beans, peas, yams, tomatoes, &c with Lemons, Oranges, Bannanna's, plantains, sugar cane, coco nuts, with many vegitables supply this market at cheap rates. Almost every article kept by the Grocers, Dry good Merchants, hardware houses and other merchantile establishments of the States may be found here, but some of the are extravigantly dear. The custom house stands upon the main plaza facing a wooden pier upon the river. Coffee, sugar, rice, tea, tobacco and some other articles are virtually prohibited by their duties. Our party had about $20 worth of the essence of tea, the duties of which was over $30. No. 2 is the dwelling of Mr. Chase the American Counsil.The costom house officers are in general exceedingly punctilious and exact, but a small gold piece, has occasionally induced some of them as in other parts of the Republic, to put on  green spectacles. Our company of 40. were all presented to a tall thin and dignified praefect or chief Alcalde, who signed each pasport, for which he charged each $1. We occupied 3 large rooms in a retired part of the city,  near one of the principal barracks, and a part of the  time cooked our own provisions. We saw several military parades, as large forces were temporarily stationed here,  to prevent a rise on the part of the citizens of this city and State for independence, and annexation to Texas, or  in plain words Annexation to the United States. There was a patroll of small parties of Soldiers with  drum, fife, beaugles, &c. at almost every hour of the day. The complexion of the Mexicans is generally copper, bronze, and sometimes almost black. Their hair black and straight and their features partaking much of the Indian. I think  there is a marked difference between the features and the  color of the Spaniard and the Aztec Indian of Mexico, but they are called Mexicans. The real Aztec occupies generally the lower grades of life, but they appear tobe by far the most honest, sociable, polite, and hospitable. Though, as in other countries there are very conspicuous exceptions. The Sabbath is but little observed here, church open with most of the stores &c in the morning, and all closed in the  afternoon, for dances called fandango's, cockfights and other amusements, etc. You can get a good cup of coffee on the  plaza, or at the \"Caffe de Reverdy\" for a maydue or 6 1/4 cts. toast bread 6 1/4 cts. a cup of excellent chocolate one Real. 12 1/2 cts. eggs 12 1/2 cts per doz. about 2 1/2 lbs of coarse sugar for a  Quartee or 3 cent piece of silver. Flour is high, and bread dear. Tortelias are very common, when well made they are excellent, they are simply finely pulverized corn baked in large thin wafers, until they snap like thin sea biscuit. The Mexicans do not generally live as well nor in the  same manner as those of the States with some exceptions. I have however, tasted pastries here surpassing any thing of the  kind in the States. Good wine from 37 1/2 to 75. cts per bottle. Freoles, or black beans, plenty, cheap, and excellent. In  dress they are peculiar, with many varieties of fashion, and possibly as different from the Americans (in general) as may be found throughout the whole world. A tapering and broad rim hat called a Sombrero; often a tight  [*But meals are usually charged from 25 to 50. cts. and their appendages in proportion.*]and curiously figured buckskin jacket, over clean linen,  a pair of figured buckskin pants opening and buttoning up from top to heel, under the right and left arm, being small above and as broad as a Sailor below; they are generally unbuttoned as high as the knee or the pocket, exhibiting a pair of fine white linen pants beneath, which are also quite airy. The Mexicans are very clean in their dress, in this respect they far surpass the United States. Even our servants or mule drivers, were dressed in their  clean white linens; a thing most remarkable for this country considering their state of civilization. The Cargador or porter will carry a box or package, and yet appear not to soil his fine linen. The high tariffs of Mexico, prevent  the coarser articles from being imported, consequently the  Mexican markets abound with the finest foreign goods. The cloth, or linen is confiscated if it does not count so many threads to the inch when passing the custom house. Lands held in this country from old titles is good, but that from the government is not safe. Mr. Chase, our American  consul, says that during his stay of 15 years at Tampico, he has known the Mexican government to change 16 times consequently their laws, &c. are but temporary powers of vacilationIt is necessary to have a pasport to enter this country which will cost $2 in the States, to countersigned by the Alcalde of each large town you pass through within 48 hours after your arrival, costing at each place 25.cts. with also a pasport to leave the country; A passport to carry arms, and a passport to carry any amount of money beyond your expenses, at 25 per cent discount. Owing to the  reports respecting the country we had to pass over to San Louis Potosi, 5 of our number withdrew and proceeded by themselves. Mr Grant, then withdrew with a large portion of our company, leaving us but 19, which embodied a separate  mining company, having with them a large amount of mining tools, provisions, medicines, etc. amounting to considerable baggage which the other division thought would detain them some weeks longer in getting through to Mazatlan; consequently that party of 16 organized and proceeded some 5 days in advance of us, and procuring their horses at Mr. Laflers Rancho, or farm, they proceeded with dispatch to San Louis Potosi etc. Our party after selling off some unnecessary articles (as every pound to Mazatlan cost us 40 cts.) proceeded on the journey, having obtained our horses of Mr Lafler; 16 miles up the river of Paneuco. The other party of course expectedto be in San Louis Potosi, at least for 8 days ahead of our tardy mules and mustangs. They arrived in San Louis Potosi on the evening of the 21st of March, and our party at sun rise next morning to their surprise, as this journal from Tampico, will show. During our stay in Tampico, many of our party formed acquaintances in this city friendly to the Americans, a disposition evinced throughout the state of Tamaulipas. The weather here is quite as hot as august in the States,  but a fine sea breeze comes from the Gulf of Mexico, every afternoon; that makes our perambulations about town more pleasant. The Senioretta's or Ladies wear no bonnets, but invariably shawls upon their heads, I have seen some that were very beautiful; the early evening is their favorite time of appearance. This is decidedly a great country for moschitoes, ticks, and all kinds of loathesome vermin as we will herein after prove. The States bear not the slightest resemblance in species, quantities, and qualities to them, as they are positively the most numerous and most troublesome inhabitants of Mexico. To pick off 3 or 500 ticks from your pants and coat, as the cost of a venture in some places among the small weeds and bushes, might seem unreasonable, but such is very possible to occurSund 25th  The Priest, has extended an invitation to our company to  attend church. I visited and found but few present. The church is handsomely decorated inside but has a very  antiquated appearance without.  26th No rain and weather excessively warm, and moschetoes  innumerable, and insupportable. I repaired to the bluff  on the river, and from the highest part of it sketched  scene No 3, which comprehends an extensive and interesting  range of country. The first river to the right passing north  is the Rio Tamosee. West of it is the rio Paneuco,  a beautiful little stream meandering off towards San  Louis Potosi, and navigable 150 miles for light draught  boats, through no steamers have yet ascended it for. at fig. 1  is Laflers' Rancho 16 miles up the river; west of it for about  20 miles there is a level prairie. The Mountains fig. 2.  are interesting, as they abound with numerous ancient  walls, curiosities, and remains very similar to those discovered  in Yucatan, by Stephens. An ancient city is  supposed to have covered a number of square miles  on the summet of this mountain; which has been described by Norman of New Orleans. Beyond this west by south  two peaks of immense and distant mountains may be seen  occasionally by a clear sun set.South (fig 3) There is a long and beautiful Lagoona or Lake being about 2 miles wide, beyond it in the direction of Vera Cruz, there are high mountains and fertile plains. In the foreground there is a long tract of prarie, covered with the wild prarie grass, some chaparell bushes, with occasional  patches of low timber, and skirted on the margin of both waters with brushy trees, and one Rancho or (small) farm. [*Mond March 5th*] Weather warm, and yet no rain, but a pleasant  breeze each afternoon. Having all baggage in readiness and our bargains completed for horses and mules, we  embarked with everything belonging to our party in large canoes, in which we made the best of our way up to Laflers' Rancho 16 miles up the Rio Paneuco, to his principal farm or Haciendo, which I sketch'd as in No 4. Showing the Paneuco river, the neighboring mountain which contains its ancient remains of a past city on it and the curious forest in its foreground. This is the  best house on this river. This gentleman is an extensive landholder, his personal property extends  over more than 50 square miles, which he says he purchased some 12 or 14 years ago for $800. He came here originally from the State of Ohio. He has an immense tract, stock, grain, servants &c.and raises Sugar Cane, Coffee, bannanas, Corn, and  many other things, and is the only person I see about  this section of the country making brick. During our  short stay at this pleasant rancho, Mr Thompson, one of  our party obtained a guide over the river, and proceeded out to the ancient city upon the mountain; he reports the way to be difficult and exceedingly unpleasant, but he considered himself amply repaid in beholding some of the  scattered remains of old stone walls, parts of dwellings, implements &c. I was informed in Tampico, that a large  block of stone, appearing to have been part of a monument, was raised there, with an inscription upon the under surface, below it there was another similar block, which has not yet been removed. There are many very interesting matters there for the Antiquarian: Mr  Thompson having shot a deer, returned at Sun set with it, which  was very acceptable to our company. Our party were very much annoyed by clouds of voracious moschetoes, and other exceedingly repugnant insects swarming upon all the undergrowth and weeds of this region of country. At this Haciendo, our dinners were of the best the  country afforded, including a great variety of new dishes.Tuesd 6th Day clear and very warm; our baggage was repacked and carefully weighed; and likewise assorted for mule loads. Horses, mules, and pack saddles was the business of the day Wed 7th Day clear and hot. This morning opened with the buz of preparation for marching to Mazatlan; but for many unprepared considerations, it was postponed one day. Thursd 8th Day clear and hot. Having hired our mules, mustangs and four servants from Mr Lafler, and our guide Don Francisco, being in command as director of our order of march, as interpreter, Sub Commissary &c. and our other officers being elected -- and having carefully loaded all our arms -- we commenced our line of march, -- at 10 A.M. upon an extensive levil and variegated prairie. Westward ho! all in lively spirits; the first large city to which we  looked forward with interest, was San Louis Potosi,  a distance from Tampico of about 350 miles, though variously estimated from 3 to 400 miles according to route. The appearance of our company completely equipped with with guns, rifles, revolvers, knives, swords, &c. was anything but pleasant for a guerrilla to look at, some of which we anticipated meeting. half the day we marched upon a prairie plain, a part of whichhad no timber and scarcely any vegetation. We passed a  pleasant little lake upon which there was an immense quantity of wild game, that was easily approached. in the afternoon we got among some woodland hills, with  a small allowance of very bad water. Our road was only  a very indifferent mule path, and not passible for a  vehicle of any kind, and continues thus quite to S.L. Potosi. On the way we saw immense droves of cattle and horses, roving at large upon the prairies. In the afternoon we  passed a caravan from San Louis Potosi. The road being very dusty, the sun excessively hot, water scarce and bad,  and but little available shade; we were of course quite glad to close this days journey, in camp at a small bamboo hut, on the bank of the Rio Paneuco. - and an  interesting group of dusty travellers we were too, with  a regular saw mill appetite. Freoles, or black beans, with  coffee and corn tortelias, were served round for supper, and notwithstanding they were previously out of credit; they passed very current on this occasion. Our beds and blankets were then spread at random upon the  ground in the open air; and a guard of two set, for every two hours of the night, on the first of which I served two  hourswith my comrade Mr Bods, being from 8 to 10. An early Moon rose upon the meandering and placid waters of the beautiful Rio Paneuco, and a gentle breeze played  fitfully in the overarching foliage around over camp. This was a fit time to remind one of those pleasant evenings at home, of scenes in our native land. Friday 9th Day clear & hot. Got on march before daylight and marched 9 leagues, (27 miles) through a hot sun, dusty paths, winding hither and thither over small hills and bushy plains of no peculiar interest, with no dinner  and a short allowance of very bad limestone water. This evening we anchored again a bamboo cabin, on the banks of the Rio Paneuco, very similar to the last, and found a very short allowance of provisions at  this place. A part of our party went into the river to bathe and found the water quite warm. They were cautioned  however about Alligator gars &c, which are  sometimes dangerous. We camped again in the open air. Sat 10th Day clear & hot. Commenced our march before daylight; being 7 leagues (21 miles) for the day. Travelled most of this day over plains, covered with forest of  palm trees, with dense undergrowth of palmettos.from which the palm fans are made, this change of  scenery was new and very interesting to us. It reminded  me much of the descriptions of palm forrest in Africa and  India, frequently for miles we saw no other trees than  several varieties of the palm, sometimes scattering, and  at others compact reminding one too of the Jersey pines, when seen at a distance. These palms afford but little shade, and grow here usually to the height of from 40 to 50 feet, without branches or leaves, save only upon their very summets. An American unaccustomed to such  very singular scenes cannot comprehend fully from description the majesty they impose at first sight upon the mind of the lover of the wild in Nature. View us winding our way in single file, with baggage mules in advance, with coats off, and red flannen, as  conspicuous; with arms glistening in the mid days sun, the arrearo's or mule drivers singing out with their incessant \"mulah\", the guide ahead  smoking his cigaretto, or little paper cigar, and the  rest of the travellers following like a flock of spring birds in complete tune, and merry felicity, among dust, sunshine, and the shadeless forrests of palm. [*20*] In places however the palms, and palmettos arched over our road.and gave us a partial shade for a short period, then we would come up on an open plain, followed by a regular forrest of various trees, massive, dense, and overgrown with immense vines, and peculiar trees for occasional undergrowth; next a few small hills, then a brushy plane, followed again and again with the forrests of palm. Parrots and many other birds of gay plumage were very abundant and exceedingly noisy. Here and there the grass and brush have been fired and burned off for many miles. We encamped again at a bamboo cabin on the Rio Paneuco, very similar to the last, here again most of our party bathed in the river. I saw some diminutive watermellons at this Rancho, and helped to taste one. Our fare at this place was reasonable, but charges superior. The water is still very indifferent and strong of limestone. 11th Day clear and hot. Started early for a Rancho on the  Tamouin & Paneuco. 9 leagues (27 miles) The scenery of this day was much diversified and interesting with palms, plains, hills, gullies, brushes, and forrests. Among which I saw very many curious Banyan trees, or the wild figg tree. So curious were they, that if time had permitted I should have, certainlysketched a number of them. I think it is the same species of the Banyan tree of India. I saw several  cases of palm trees completely imbedded in the very trunks of immense Banyan trees, and being quite ornamental  to it. This tree returns from its from its branches direct  in a perpendicular line very frequently to the ground  in long cords like ropes, which take root and spring up again, in many shapes and sizes, and in many  cases more than a hundred times from one large tree. On this days march we saw several curious Mounds. We arrived at the Tamowin about 3.P.M, and after sending all baggage over with ourselves in [a] canoes,  we finished our crossing by swimming the horses & mules,  on the opposite bank we encamped at a large and  good looking Rancho, being at the junction of the  rivers Paneuco and Tamowin. Here we purchased a calf of good size for $.3.00, and prepared him accordingly, for further use upon the way. Water still unpalatable. This evening a part of our company were in to swim again. From circumstances we inferred trouble with guerrillas, but the guards were vigilant, and we left at 1.O.clock next  morning winding over way through a forest by moonlight.Mond. 12th Day clear & hot. Proceeded by early moonlight (1.O. clock) on our way for Villa de Viase. At sunrise we arrived at the first- Mountain on our way called the \"Siera Madre\" or Mother Mountain. Before entering the pass, the traveller will find a valuable warm Sulpher Spring, of great medicinal properties not far from the path. As you approach the pass, the scene is peculiar. You walk and lead your Mustangs over a rocky path, of such barbarous rudeness that you may deem it a venture for a Mountain goat, and yet your horse must be taxed with all his personal wits to puzzle his way out over loose rocks that edge over the precipice of an almost bottomless uncertainty. The mules, -they are as sharp as Chatham Yankees, for they will carry a load, where a common man would want room to tout over his own shadow. They are perfect baggage wild cats, and climb rocks with heavy loads as if they had claws, or were cammels in the desert of Arabia. We passed over one high and exceedingly dangerous precipice,  and other unpleasant places, and finally passed through a very narry and precipitous valley that meandered like the bed of a little river diagonally across the mountain, with almost the slightgrade of a rail road, and generally not much over 300 feet in width, but steep and of great height with timber on each side edging up the mountains, the meanderings of this cavern-valley  with its hight cliffs, and little coves and passes, gave to the whole scene a peculiar wildness and Sublimity. We scared up five young deer among the rocks; It was in this mountain pass that from report, we first  anticipated some Mexican Indians, or Guerillas; in this pass they could sweep and be safe; and although our guns were several times fired, none made their appearance to us. After crossing the mountain pass, we came upon an undulating country still uninhabited, though in many places of a very rich soil, covered sometimes with good timber and now and then prarie grass, with occasional barrens of wild and cavernous limestone rocks. Entrances to caves are to be seen, and in one place a romantic spot, an immense well of an oval form descends perpendicularly through limestone rocks to a great debth. Some ancient trees bend gracefully over and around its mouth. To day also, I found the remains of an ancient town and the appearance of an ancient fort on our way to the village de Viase. Revd Mr Woods and myself passed on in the advance of the trainMarch, 1849.  a mile or two, with the view of arriving at the village in  advance of the train. on the way just as we had pas a  slight bend of the road, we saw five uncouth looking Mexicans sitting on the bank of a dry creek; the wispered suspiciously until we came beside them, when they all arose at once with sticks, and gathered around us, supposing something rong on foot, I drew my gun from its sheath, and exhibited also my revolver and knife. Mr Woods prepared himself also by exarming his gun &c. These fellows followed us a short distance evidently meditating our arms, when they fell  off from us on being told that many Americans were just behind. We arrived in the village early in the afternoon, and found Mr Grants division just on the point of leaving for S.L. Potosi. This being the place where all our horses had to be shod for the mountains to come. We encamped on the village plaza, pitched our tents, prepared our own food, &c. Tuesd 13th Day hot and clear, examined the appearance of the village with friends, and obtained a good bowl of coffee two eggs and bread on the plaza for 1 Real, 12 1/2 cts. We have discovered that  Milk, Eggs, freeoles, tortelias, Oranges, and Coffee may be  readily obtained at almost every place; all of which  are very cheap, except coffee. On the Plaza of thisvillage there stands the remains of an Ancient Catholic Church. The Cupola is yet in a tollerable State of preservation and 3 bells yet hang in it of a very Anti- quated appearance. Upon its summet shrubs, cactus, grass may be seen as luxuriant as upon Terra firma. Vide sketch No 5. To the right of it is a long bamboo  building thatched with palmetoes; in it the Catholic citizens hold their Service. From appearances within we judge this chappel to contain more real wealth than many of those magnificent edifices of the States. This day was occupied in Shoeing our horses. Mr. Lafler of Tampico came in the village some 90 miles from his Rancho in order to have them properly attended too, the Shoes having been brought here from Tampico. The price of Shoeing here is from 3 to 5 dollars per horse, in the States about one dollar. Here they most generally throw the animal upon the  ground and tie him there with ropes. The Smith shops and other mechanical departments appear more like burlesques than the representation of a half civilized people. This morning I ascended the cupola of the plaza ruins and then beheld a beautiful view of the Siera Madre Mountains 12 miles westward as in Sketch No. 6.The foreground from the mountain was nearly a levil plane, intersperced here and there with apparent clearings, which in several cases proved to be small open and natural praries, probably never cleared by the hand of man, as they were not much used. A small rapid and romantic river passes under a deep bluff beside the village, where our party were again into bathe, as the day was excessively hot and the water agreeable. The peaks of the Siera Alta, appeared like a cloud in the distance. In offering a pass to the  traveller these mountains are very high and formidable. Just as I had completed this sketch the priest of the parish a very pleasant man ascended the tower and expressed much pleasure at finding me sketching, and thereupon requested me to descend and dine with him, to which I complied with much pleasure, in descending the tower in a shady recess, he placed my arms around  himself he also embraced me, with much feeling, and said that he liked the Americans. His dinner was served  up in the best Mexican style, with wine and numerous new dishes, served in about 8 or10 changes of plates. I left much gratified with his hospitality. Our horses being in readiness, at 4.P.M. we commenced our marchtoward the foot of the Siera Madre Mountains. In leaving and crossing the river by the ford, it was very gratifying to see about 90 or 100 Mexicans upon the high bluffs and along the road to see us out and bid us a friendly adieu, and Adios, adios, adios, was echoed here, there and yonder, which signifies - \"to God\"- we commend you. We travelled some 10 miles this evening and camped in a wild spot about 2 miles from the foot of the mountain. My sketchbook, a satchell, and a coat belonging to Mr Sayre, were lost after dark before camping, but 3 of us returned by moonlight before sun rise and found them. Our camp fire looked really interesting this evening with the sentinals parading around the sleepers who where rolled  up in blankets; who constantly watched among the timbers and bushes for enemy and wholves, the latter of which made themselves known before daylight. [*Wedn 14th.*] Day hot & clear. Arose before before daylight and proceeded to the Siera Madre Mountain. As we ascended, I observed numerous scattering mounds, parts of old walls &c, the timber became large and dense. I believe that there is a spring (the only one from Tampico to S Louis Potosi) not far from the road to the right as you ascend the mountain.our path over the mountain was in ascent by windings about 3 miles, and nearly the same in descending over the opposite side and other hills. The whole scenery was wild beyond description. Could this road or path be exhibited in a civilized country, it would be considered dangerous even for a mountain goat; how then shall I describe it, when a painter would consider it beyond a just representation if skillfully drawn. We lead our horses up the  steep precipitous masses, jumping and scrambling from  rock to rock sometimes two feet perpendicularly. The most ragged and cragged ledges, holes, chasms, and peaks that  the mind could picture for feats in horsemanship. Reader! you have doubtless seen nominally bad roads in the States, but they convey only a faint idea of the  hardships you must encounter in passing the formidable crags upon these mountains of distracted rudeness. Having surmounted the first Series, we descended upon  similar sharp and pointed edges into a wild and  romantic cove, leading off over and around other more  passable hills, in full view of numerous mountains ranging at random in every direction, until we reached the Ranch la Pier, by a small lakeupon a beautiful plane, and here we encamped for the night, having arrived early in the afternoon. The proprietor of the Rancho, is an Alcalde of wealth, and a man of affable manners. Before sun set we ascended a neighboring hill and sketched scene No. 7. including a large assemblage of distant mountains. The setting sun cast back their shadows upon the planes, as I descended, and lent a passing beauty to them ever to be remembered. From advice given us by the Alcalde, it was thought advisable to change our rout over the mountains to San Louis Potosi, by a nearer and more safe direction. The Mexican forces, and Indians or Guerrillas, being  upon the regular route, which would cause us trouble. The first division having gone that way unadvised, they met with difficulties, detention, and considerable danger. Thurs 15th Day clear & hot. Entered upon the nearer route, and passed palm forrests, old fortifications, and a fine little river, where  we filled our canteens with refreshing and cool water, the best from Tampico, and accomplished a long march and 6 or 7 formidable mountains of worse paths than any previously travelled. To describe our labours on these volcanic rocks of gothic masonry, would be romantic indeed.but suffice it to be said that this days march was  the most wild rugged and exhausting of any to San Louis Potosi. On this route I had the pleasure of discovering a  magnificent cavernous Amphitheatre of several thousand feet in diameter, and about 300 feet in perpendicular  debth, covered below with dense timber, and overhung with high arching cliffs of great magnificence. Our mountain scenery today was exceedingly grand though we enjoyed it but little owing to the difficult passes to be encountered. Many of the mountains had no timber, nor even vegetation upon them; being vast masses of rude brown rocks particularly upon their summets. Had time permitted, I should have sketched some of these alpine scenes of barrenness for the information and curiosity of my friends and readers. They are totally unlike anything I ever before saw  in point of complete barrenness and appeared really savage. At sunset we descended into a romantic valley and wound around several Sugarloaf hills, by dark into the beautiful village of San Nicholas, where we encamped upon a pleasant plaza of grass in the midst of the village and at the foot of a large and imposing mountain.but suffice it to be said that this days march was the most wild rugged and exhausting of any to San Louis Potosi.

At sun set we descended into a romantic valley and wound round several Sugarloaf hills, by dark into the beautiful village of San Nicholas, where we encamped upon a pleasant plaza of grass in the midst of the village and at the foot of a large and imposing Mountain.seen bearing much resemblance to a volcano. Whilst watering our horses at a pond in this valley, two suspicious Mexicans appeared, one over the pond, and the other near us apparently examining our arms, &c. and in a short time one of them made bold to tell two of our party that  he was one of a party defeated by the Mexican Government, and that they were many, who were now in persuit of  plunder, both of them were handsomely dressed, and rode upon first class animals. We turned to the left from this interesting valley, through a pass in the hills similar to  No 9. when we came in view of the beautiful and-- romantic village of Tortugas, or village of turtles, where we arrived at 4 P.M. and located ourselves in a  small brush school house, upon a small riding ground well adapted to defence, as an attack of the Guerrillas was looked for, as quite certain during the night. Many of the inhabitants collected around us with curiosity and pleasure, as they hoped we would be of service to them in case of an attack of the Guerrillas or robbers. We were all in anticipation of a fight, when we saw a small fire upon the summit of a neighboring mountain, supposed to be a signal light. Guns, pistols &c were allwith here and there patches of stunted vegetation, growing among the wild mountain rocks. Among these I saw a number of strange and interesting trees, curious plants, magueys, palmettoes, coco's, and a strange fruit resembling the pine apple, being twice as large, and filled with numerous small soft white fruits, much resembling in appearance and taste the common chesnut, which were very abundant on one of the mountains. I also saw a shrub or bean plant bearing flowers, resembling skeins of white & red silk, from 1 to 2 inches in thickness, and from 4 to 6 inches in length. On this days march we passed through many very peculiar mountains, scenes of interest. No 9 (sketch.) was taken on horseback whilst passing into the valley of corn. No 10. is a view of the Valle de Maise, or valley of corn, looking to the north. This valley is about one mile in width, and many in length. The hills upon either side are nothing of nearly void of vegetation, the whole valley is divided into large fields for corn, and well improved with stone fences. The soil is rich and corn flourishes here luxuriantly. Far on the northern horizon a high mountain wasall of which grew from 4 to 15 feet in height, and chiefly among the interstices of the rocks. It appeared to be a  section of country almost useless for any purpose, and it  really appeared strange, how such a barren wilderness of  of thorns could be at all inhabited where water was  also very bad and scarce; in the afternoon we travelled among clouds of dust, with a hot sun and but little breeze. before sunset we encamped under a tree, beside, a desolate mud dwelling upon a deasert plane, much like a scene in the desert of Arabia, appearing quite as barren and  forlorn, as the immagination could well picture as in sketch No 13. A large old fashioned rope and pulley well, was in the  vicinity, at which about 40 Mexican women, were engaged in drawing water, and carrying it away in large earthen jars upon their heads, bearing a striking resemblance to the old Egyptian costoms, in dress, color, and manners. At this place we fared slim and paid well for it. Sund 18th   Day clear and warm. Proceeded on our journey at 6.A.M. very  anxious to get out of this barren and sandy wilderness. and travelled nearly all day over diversified planes of  limestone, palms, maguays, casters, some timber, and for a  mile or two, for the first time a woodland of beautiful cedars.put in the best order, our camp fire put out, and two guards put on duty. The Alcalde paid us a friendly visit, and many of the inhabitants brought us cheap provissions, and the night passed off without trouble. [*Sat. 17th.*] Day clear and warm. The inhabitants came in numbers to bid us a friendly adios. I pencil'd sketches No 11. and 12. just before leaving showing on No 11. our position in camp at the school house, and an opposite view looking South. Oranges flourish here, and are  very cheap, eggs are plentiful, with many useful articles of provissions. Soon after leaving this pleasant village, we ascended several large and barren hills, and in a few hours descended a very romantic pass down upon prarie plains and cultivated fields. our views on this days journey were extensive new diversified and interesting. We came to a  small village of a very romantic appearance, beside a little stream of water, where at first the inhabitants were much terrified at our appearance. We saw but little timber, during the whole day, the planes and  hills, being almost covered with wild cactus, prickley pears, and the short scrubby palms, etc.At intervals for several miles, the ground was as white as the very snow of a northern winter, having a saline taste, in places, in others that of Epsom Salts, and as fine as the very best flour. Caverns were beneath, for we  could often hear the footsteps of our horses echoing beneath, and now and then a chasm or deep pit would  appear. When timber appeared in the usual form of groups or clusters, it usually had a singular appearance, much resembling extensive Apple, and  Peach orchards. The country had conspicuous marks of a volcanic origin upon a limestone foundation. We were almost constantly in sight of distant ranges of lofty and rugged mountains, lending romance to the day. and now and then large planes, covered with prairie grass would extend for before the eye to the mountains skirted here and there with pleasant shady woodlands. We arrived at the Hacienda about 4. P.M. and were  gratified to find it a place much superior to the last,  not only for provisions, but also for shade and comfort. About 9.O.clock this morning we arrived at a place on the valley plane, where a stream of clear and very strong limestone water meandered from a small lake, and in a short distancedisappeared beneath the ground; this water though clear and cold, was so strongly impregnated with the Carbonate of lime, that though we were very thirsty, we could scarcely drink it. During a temporary halt, I sketch'd this lake No. 12 [*14*], and its vicinity southward. Game was plentiful here, and  several of our party delay'd some on account of it. Mr Sherman, one of the same , remained there so long that  in persuit of our caravan he missed the path and  was lost for a day and a half suffering greatly from exposure and other great dangers; after some delay, expense,  and trouble in scouring the country in various directions with a Mexican guide, he was at last found, much fatigued frightened, and sick, having encountered considerable perils. I remained some time behind the company in waiting for  Sherman, as long as I felt it safe from missing the way  myself, expecting him to come up upon this path, [during that time I sketched scene No 14. a high] on our right there was a high mountain [to] [the North] bearing the marks of a large volcano. Some of our party were in to bathe again this evening, but as our journey has elevated us much, the water is now becoming cooler especially each night, which is cold enough for two or three blankets, whilst  the mid day sun is quite hotMond 19th Day warm and clear. Proceeded on our journey at 7.O. clock. sMuch of this days journey was very similar to the last, at times winding among barren hills, small planes of cactus, thorns scattering palms, gullies and rocks, with small groves of peculiar trees of a stunted growth. Before sun set we crossed a beautiful and fertile plane under cultivation with corn, and haulted for a short time at a large well on one of the fields one and a half liles from, and in full view of the beautiful little town of Ceretus de San Juan; at the suburbs of which we encamped within a large yard for the  night. Before day light had left the hills of Ceretus, I passed through several parts of the town, and Sketched the church and plaza as in No 15. Showing the valley and hills eastward, over which we had passed during the after part of the day. The appearance of this little town is quite genteel the houses being mostly constructed of Stone and frequently whitewashed and as often secluded in pleasant Shady yards and groves of the trees and shrubs peculiar to this country.Tuesd 20th  Day warm and clear. Proceeded on our journey at 6.O.clock. Just as we were leaving the yard the horse belonging to Mr Thompson, taking fright at some object ran off through the yard, and brok his rifle into many small pieces, Mr T.--escaping unhurt. About 1 mile from  Ceretus, looking westward, I sketched scene No 16. showing the barren hills, a hacienda to the right, and the little clusters of bushes, dotting the ground like miniature islands. We were among the hills and ravines all day, and passed up one very interesting pass between barren mountains which was several  miles in length. On the way before entering this pass,  and at the commencement of a fine broad road, we  halted for a short time at a large Hacienda, called San  E Pedro No 17. having westward a beautiful mountain view, south the cultivated fields and distant hills, and around the dwelling several beautiful groves, over the principal door was painted in large letters, \"Casa Particular\". It being a public house or hotel of the  Mexican order. Having ascended through peculiar scenes of the passes, to the summet of the mountains, we then passed a long time over a wild rocky and entirely desolatewilderness, almost entirely destitute of the smallest vegetation, except in some particular spots, where small stone & mud huts of misery were now and then to be seen. Before descending we passed a small mud village in a little rocky and desolate ravine; with only a few cactus, thorns, and stunted brush, but no regular timber about it. It looked much like solitude and misery. The road has now become excellent, and for the first time we found it graded and paved as a regular road up the mountain. Wooden crosses are plentiful and conspicuous, they are more numerous now than on the way back to Tampico; Sometimes two or three in sight of each other may be seen and particularly on this days march. We are told that these crosses are erected upon the particular spots, where travelers have been murdered. if so, this is decidedly a great country. As we descended the mountain, winding our way down a dangerous pass, a beautiful plane, with a range of barren mountains 15 miles westward, appeared before us, which I hastily sketched as our party descended to the plane, as in number 18. This plane is about 15 miles in width, and almost entirely covered with a brush peculiar to this country.This plane, of the valley is quite level and of very great length, the camino that crosses it, is at least 100 feet broad, and would be an elegant road for travel if not so abundantly supplied with dust and sand. Our party were so much enveloped in dust, that during a portion of the time some of them were not distinguishable at the distance of a few rods. Clouds of dust arose high in the air, and marked in places the spots where persons were moving on many parts of the plane. Such scenes have however been long familiar to us from the very city of Tampico. At sun set we arrived at the \"Meson De Fern\" a public house called Pestelius located in a desert of sand, a few miles from a village to the north west and off from the road. At this place, we found Capt Grants' division of the Camargo Company, who met us in a sociable manner as old friends, the two divisions having taken different roads to San Louis Potosi.. Mr Chevallias' party of 5 having also arrived the whole Camargo Company were again together. At night, a high wind arose and gave us a complete storm of dust, exceeding anything of the kind that I have ever before witnessed in any country, reminding one of the desert of Arabia.Wednd 21st Day warm and clear. Capt. Grants division, left before sunrise in order to reach San Louis Potosi before night. Our company proceeded on the way an hour after, as we did not design pressing our horses and mules with a very long days march. Nos 19 and 20 are exterior and  interior views of the desert house where we camped. To the right of the house, there is a large well, which is deserving of notice; two or three hoses are fastened by beams to a vertical shaft, which by 8 right angle sticks move a horizontal beam, to which there is a wheel about 12 feet in diameter, with ropes and  about 20 leather buckets, for raising water from the  well to a trough, and from thence into a stone bason  about 60 feet square, and 8 or 10 feet in debth. This water was fair and cool, and very desirable for the country. Such wells are not frequent, and found only occasionally at the large Haciendo's or Ranchoe's of the wealthy. Water on this road from Tampico to  San Louis Potosi, is scarce, and in almost every instance very unpalatable, muddy, and dangerous to the stranger. It is therefore nescessary for travellers to be cautious in drinking the water along this route                                                                      in particular. This days journey was very similar to the last, with hills and dusty roads, with a hot sun, brushy planes, thorns, and large cactus of various forms, &c. Mountains of barren rocks were seen all day, but we travelled chiefly upon the planes. About 4 in the afternoon we arrived at the Rancho de los Soledad, previous to which I sketched scene No. 21 as we descended to the valley in which this rancho is located, This plane is very wide, and a very considerable length, on this plane about 30 miles to the left is located the city of San Louis Potosi, in full view of large Mountains, though not within several miles of any of them. No. 22 is a sketch of the Haciendo or \"Rancho de los  Solidad\", and its neighboring mountain, which I sketched before sun set, this scene is looking S. East. We encamped opposite to this in a large Mud wall with appartments for travellers as in Sketch No. 23. The inhabitants are now becoming less friendly than they were back over the mountains. And are decidedly against the Americans in the popular feeling, and have occasionally expressed those feelings with insults, and a few words of contempt, which some of them have learned from the American deserters, in the English language. We have seen a number of these contempitible shadows of white men and almost as often heard their curses, or indecent language, but we have generally left them unnoticed. At this rancho we saw a large amount of arms and lances, with an American Rifle, pistols, swords &c which led us to suspicion the character of the place strongly; we however kept our Arms and Sentinels in good trim, and were ready at the word, to show them that in defence we were the same original Americans that they might have before read about. Had our numbers been small enough to suit their taste, I have no doubt but that a fight would have resulted judging from all circumstances, questions, &c. Being in the neighborhood of S. L. Potosi, it is now absolutely nescessary to be constantly on your gard for all shapes of thieves, Robbers, Guerillos, &c., etc, etc. who appear to compose a large proportion of the population. [*Thursd 22nd*]  We left the Rancho, this morning at 3. O. clock for San  Louis Potosi, the road was broad, and lined with cactus, from 5 to 15 feet in height. We were all awake for any attack on the way. Having travelled 15 miles by 1/2 past 8.O. clock A.M. we entered the Splendid and singular city of San Louis Potosi, having passed through a beautiful little village before entering Potosi. The city is situated upon a large and beautiful plane, which is under good cultivation, and is for several miles in every direction; divided into regular right angle  \"streets and roads. The fences of the roads, if they may be so called are composed of the high pentangular cactus, growing in single stems of about 5 inches diameter to a  height of about 8, 10, or 15 feet, and frequently so close together that it is generally capable of shutting out the smallest animal. The average width of the streets are about 30 feet. A member of large and handsome species of trees range along them, with which I am not familiar, one of which resembles in bark, limb, and  site, the Locust, with leaf of a small fern. Another, has the shape and height of a poplar, with the denseness of the black thorn hedges of the States; it is a  beautiful tree of a dark green color, and very ornamental. The maguay is another peculiar plant, very abundant here; I have seen fences made of them extending many miles at a time, and very common everywhere  onour way from Tampico. All these interesting plants, trees &c. with a large number that would be  difficult to describe, but which nevertheless are exceedingly beautiful, belong to this country and are so abundant as at times to cover many miles in compact masses, so much so that it would be difficult for a man to pass among them as they all, with but little exception possess luxuriant crops of  thorns. All these species crowd the roads and surround the fields as you pass into San Louis Potosi. I also for the first time saw two peach trees in full blossom in a beautiful garden at the suburbs of the city. And many beautiful flowers of singular beauty were in full bloom likewise and filled the air with the richness of their morning fragrance. Several fine fields of ripe barley added to the view, their mellow orange hues, whilst, the plough (a rude woodden concern) was busy beside. The Orange, Lemons, and fig trees were also handsome when blended with their fruits, beneath other more conspicuous trees, among which was one called the Peru, another the China tree, andyet another larger and decorated with more exquisite brilliance than I have ever before witnessed. all these with their charming colors and luxuriance bent gracefully over our dusty roads as we passed into the great central metropolis of Potosi. The morning sun had already arrisen upon the domes, towers and minarets of Potosi, as our company entered it from the North. There was so much of the grand and the humble combined, that I could not but remark its resemblance to what I had read of St Petersburg and Moscow, as described by travellers in Russia. After wending in single file our tortuous way amid dense crowds of strange brown faces, around the various streets of the city we at last took up our quarters at the St Anthony house, which was commodious and  constructed strictly after the Mexican order, and one of the first hotels in the city, though, not by any means adapted to the ideas of Americans, being very similar to sketches Nos. 19. and 20. The suburbs of the city (which are very extensive) are almost entirely composed of miserable looking one story flat roof'd mud dwellings of a dilapidated appearance which are much inferior to  the [*34*]very lowest order of dwellings found in any part of the  States, and contrast in a very striking manner with the numerous splendid sanctuaries, public buildings, towers, domes, and superfluous grandeur of the interior city. None of our company even dreamed of the surprising splendours, which broke so suddenly upon them, when they entered the thronged plazas amid the thousands of vacant gazers who seem'd to view us as some unearthly intruders, just draft among them from some other plannet. Our ideas were never so much unhinged at when too closely crowded by dense throngs of starving Mexicans, who with wondrous eyes and  open mouths, Knew not in decency where to end their extravagant curiosity. As we entered the  streets were quick ly thronged, the windows and  iron gratings filled with Seniorettas or Ladies, the doors with wise heads and muchatcha's of boys with some upon the very house tops, to the  Americans enter into the precincts of their almost forbidden walls of China. An unfriendly feeling towards the Americans was soon evident from their language  as it was a day of religious ceremonies, and rest from labor, the church and plaza was thronged, by Mexicans dressed in their holliday best. We passed through this pleasant town, without halting and ascended a steep, high and rugged mountain at the immediate suburbs of the town. On looking back towards Amattitan, distant 14  miles to the South east and Tekelah at its base I hastily sketched the view as in No 59. On ascending this mountain I saw an animal of the Lizard Species about 2 feet in  length lying upon a large boulder rock in a ravine. After ascending we passed several miles through a  a deep, [and] very narrow, and crooked ravine among the highland hills; it was perfectly adapted to the purposes of Ladrones or Robbers, and has been recently the theatre of bloody deeds, robberies, &c. Here jet black Quartz began to appear plentiful after passing in single file for Several miles under the arches and bluffs of this wild and narrow ravine, we descended into a small and pretty valley, where there was a small farm, green fields and some water, from  this we ascended large hills, almost composed of  [*35*]the same brittle jet black quartz, before named. So much so, that it was hard upon the feet of our animals, we again descended into a gently sloping valley of about two miles in width, at the far northern end of which we could see the interesting Lake of Madalena, which I sketched on a nearer approach as in No 60. Showing the town of Madalena on the margin of the Lake, beyond which that welcome sheet of water with its interesting mountain scenery appeared, reminding one much of similar scenes in Italy and Switzerland; and rather unlike many other Mexican towns. At this place we stopped in a comfortable mason overnight, halting about 4 P.M. An opportunity offering I went and upon the margin of the lake and sketched view No 61 looking west among the mountains over which the sun was setting. Also No 62 looking south east towards part of the town Madalena is a town of a shady and pleasant appearance. Most of its streets are narrow and crooked, but well shaded in general. The plaza, was of good size and had a fine large antiquated church upon the south eastern side of it. Around which there was a large crowd of worshippers,uncivil manners, and in two of our party being stoned upon the city plaza; all of which we readily discovered and were particularly cautious, in being upon our guard, whilst we were frequently rendering civilities for incivilities. To these however we are happy to state that there were a number of exceptions, among the higher classes, and the better informed, which gave us a better opinion of Potosi, than we otherwise should  have had. We were nearly three days in this interesting city during which time whilst our guide was preparing fresh mustangs &c for our further journey to Mazatlan; and having some opportunities, I availed myself of them in visiting and sketching some of the massive and beautiful churches &c, having first obtained permission from an alcalde's clerk in the Governors' Palace, to visit and sketch as I wish'd. I proceeded in company with an American friend about 1 1/2 miles south from  the city, towards the Mosa Mountain, where from the remains of an old mud fort, I sketched the domes  &c of the city as in No 24. nearly all of which belong to magnificent churches erected many years past by the Spaniards at enormous costs, and decorated  in theinterior with gorgeous and the most exhorbitant displays of wealth and splendour that the human immagination could well conceive of, and far exceeding any thing of the kind to be found in the States. An open plane of more than a mile in extent each way extended between the fort and the city, upon which several hundred Mexican soldiers were exercising with targets, drilling &c. At this time large forces are concentrated here, who appear to be preparing for political struggles for power. To the right of this open plane, there are four parallel rows of the beautiful Alamo trees forming a shady and a very pleasant walk of about one mile from the city proper southward to the front  of the magnificent sanctuary (Santoario) as in fig 25. At each end and along this walk there are handsomely ornamented fountains. No 25 is a view of the Sanctuary and Mosa Mountains from the same position, where fig 24 was taken. A nearer view of the Sanctuary was then taken from the front near a fountain, as in fig 26, including two fountains two neat gardens, and the style of seats surrounding the principal fountain. The workmanship upon this magnificent edifice appears to be a contribution of the various orders ofArchitecture which in execution I believe to be superior to any thing similar which I have seen in the States. Not even excepting Trinity Church in New York, and composed of a hard red sand stone very similar to the one named. This church though over a mile from the city was under military guard, from whom I asked permission to enter but was told that the chief key of the Sanctuary was in the posession of the Captain, who was out drilling his  men upon the plane beforementioned. On returning to the city we passed a number of handsome edifices of  singular and antiquated appearance, but my opportunities limited me in sketching many of them. The streets were thronged in almost every direction, and should one attempt a sketch in their presence, a crowd of noisy gabbling superstitious men, women, and children, would soon compell a retreat, at the risk of being stoned, amid the jeers, and language suiting degraded and grossly ignorant minds. I was told there were over fifty handsome Sanctuaries or churches in this city, which from appearances I doo not doubt. None but the Catholic religion is tolerated here as in other parts of the Republic, and in passing each Sanctuary, even upon the opposite side of the street, the person is required to takeoff his hat, and retain it in his hand, until he has passed the door of the Sanctuary, otherwise he is liable to be stoned at the shortest notice; if nothing worse may happen him. I'm entering the church during service he is required to kneel, and to accompany respectfully in the ceremonies of the church. The interior splendors of these numerous churches, I could not describe in justice within my present compass. Their displays are gorgeous in the highest degree of man's ingenuity; and frequently exhibit much of the Theatrical; in some instances the walls and high gothic roof, being entirely covered with thousands of gothic (relief) devices, are entirely gilt with gold or silver leaf, until the whole interior glitters like a solid golden palace, with richly ornamental chandaliers, lights of various colors, hundreds of Statues of life size, adorned in robes of brilliant colors, gems, in great profusion, magnificent organs, select gallaries for the paintings, relicts, and statues of the saints, in one apartment of the St Domingo Sanctuary I was shown the bones of saints, and such other things as would fill a volume to describe.On returning to the main plaza, I sketched the Palace  of the governor as in fig 27. a crowd of noisy belligerents soon manifested a a jeering aspect, which compelled me  to finish my sketch rather hastily. I then passed off hastily until I had eluded the noisy crowd of  ignorammus's and by permission getting upon the  roof of a house. I sketched therefrom the beautiful  and very extensive Sanctuary of \"San Francisco\" as in  fig 28. showing its domes, cupolas, and spires as it appeared from the North east corner. Its bells  are numerous of many tones, and remarkably fine; the  interior like an immense museum, is crowded, with  wealth, and splendours beyond description. It has  as near as I can judge over, one thousand apartments,   a part of which are very elegant in their styles, guildings,  statues, paintings, stuccoed works, altars, tombs, vaults,  organs, galleries, painted domes, stained glass, chandeliers, massive gilt gothic works &c. &c. It covers a large  square, and is almost a royal city of itself. I after proceeded  to the Church and College of St. Josephs, which I  sketched as in No 29. My visits also extended to the magnificent  Sanctuary of St. Domingo, the front of which wasGuarded by a large mounted Cannon, and in a house, beside it several hundred soldiers. The interior of this great  church was the most gorgeous I ever beheld, its walls  and gothic ceiling was so gilt with gold leaf, as to appear  like one immense golden gothic palace. The Captain  of this division politely accompanied me through the  church, explaining its sacred relicts, &c. Among which  I saw immages of Angels, about 4 feet in height appearing to be cast of Gold, encased in splendid cases over  the grand Altar. A similar image of the Virgin  and Saviour sitting upon a throne of very massive  silver clouds, over which was an immense dome  inlaid with porcelain of rich colors. There was A large and  beautiful Organ upon a highly ornamented gallery, resting  upon Lions, that seemed watching the congregation,  And numerous saints in richest robes, (of nearly full  size) were to be seen in every direction. The interior  forum of the church was that of a cross, having two  magnificent Altars. I asked permission to sketch this  fine church from the little plaza front, but was  told that it could not be granted, without a  special permit. I then proceeded to sketch theyards, with numbered cells, in which from 10 to 30 may sleep on a brick pavement, having their own blankets of course. There is usually a cook shop in one of these cells, called a \"Fonda,\" where coffee, meat &c. are prepared to order, and usually well charged for; although the cooking may be very inferior to any thing in the States. In chocolate, however, the Mexicans excel, and sometimes in coffee, and especially in light sweet cakes. March  25th.  (Sunday)  Our company (of between 40 and 50,)  Left San Louis Potosi this morning at half past five, in double file presenting to the gazing crowds quite a military face, as red flannel was very conspicuous on almost every man, for almost every coat was off, it being clear moderately warm, and very dusty for a time. In the distance the city appeared beautiful and interesting. We soon entered upon open and barren rolling hills, where I found several handsome specimens of agate scattered among gravel. I neither heard of, or saw any of the silver mines of this State, though I believe them to exist in Durango, Zacatecas, and the state of San Louis Potosi, as large silver trains pass down to Tampico from this country, every few weeks. [*38A*]about 10 miles from San Louis, we entered upon some very rocky hills, into deep ravines, several narrow vallies and through narrow passes, with a cross here and there at short intervals, marking the spot where some traveller has been murdered, and his remains, if poor, deposited beneath. Our company was composed of over 40 American two Spanish guides, 8 Arrearos' or mule drivers, (Mexican) and 14 pack mules to carry our baggage allowing 150lbs. to each mule in order to travel with speed and safety. Our guns, pistols, swords, knives, &c. were all ready for immediate use, and were kept in excellent order, and many of our boys made the vallies echo with their jovial songs whilst passing, at the same time keeping an eye for any vagrant Guerrillas among the cliffs and brushes. One of the narrow vallies through which we passed during this day was peculiarly romantic, whilst a broad creek filling nearly the width of this valley of precipices, meandered with it; the bed of this creek, was in most places almost dry, so that we travelled some miles upon beds of gravel. At one place, on passing up the side of a precipitous, volcanic hill, I saw a very great quantity of handsome Geods of Calcedony, scatteredchief plaza looking eastward, including the fountain The Parroquia, a fine church, and a small part of   St Domingo east of it. A crowd of idle male and female spectators soon assembled around me bobbing continually their ugly phiz's directly in my face, so as interrupt, and intercept the view I was sketching -- presently two officers in military uniform, arrested me, and proceedded with me to an Alcalde's office, at the left base of the Governors' Palace. He wished to know  if I had a permit to sketch, I informed him that I had from the Praefectas' Clerk; upon which he discharged me and sent an officer (in uniform) to accompany me to my former seat on the Plaza, who stood by me with drawn sword, and like a gallant man kept men, women, and boys, at full bey, until I had finished my task, when he left me with a polite bow, &c. No 30, represents that sketch on the chief plaza. This plaza is almost always densely crowded by  all grades and classes of people, who stare as much as Americans, as though they were Bedouin Arabs; No 31. is a red sand stone fountain, which I sketched in the Southern port of the city at the head of the Allamo                                           walk before described.It is much of the time crowded by visitors for water, No 32. is the chief market plaza; upon this plaza are numerous Doric pillars, well finished from red sand rock, it is intended in time to place a roof upon them so as to shelter the market to be held therein. This view is looking north, at the present time the markets are held around the principal building. A good cup of coffee can be had here for a Mordeau 6 1/4 ct and mellons with many other things proportionably cheap. At this date 25th March, water mellons &c. are plentiful and cheap; the markets appeared flush with delicious fruits, oranges, mellons, cantelopes, bannannas, &c. etc; but no apples or peaches; no walnuts, chesnuts, or hickory nuts, yet similar though better than the market of Tampico. The scenery about San Louis Potosi is in places romantic and interesting when combined with the distant mountain scenery of the Southwest; the contrast of mud huts with splendid edifices and the superb residences of the wealthy are very striking and is the first thing to be observed by every traveller. At this place, they are decidedly hostile to theAmericans, partly I presume from the late war and in part from religious education. At evening the  Host, or priests, pass around in a fine carriage, drawn by mules; before which a number are seen walking, each carrying his candle, whilst several small bells, are tinkling to the heavy toll of deep tone'd bells of the Sanctuary every person male, female, young & old, must Kneel to  the host whilst passing This is a strict religious  ceremony, the nonobservance of which brings at once  upon the head of the disobedient immediate dangers  either in being stoned, or possibly something worse,  besides inculcating the ill will of the observers. In  San Louis, though there are English, French, and  some Americans, yet they are much more strict  in Religious observances than in Tampico, and  Americans should be more on their guard in  passing into the interior of Mexico and westward. As near as I could ascertain, the population of  San Louis Potosi, is about 75 thousand. The proportion of which are illitterate Mexicans of the Indian  race, called Mexican Indians. They are usually clothed  indifferently, live similar in mud huts, upon mud  floors, andlead a servile life, or one of complete indolence. Our Company remained 3 days in San Louis in order to purchase some fresh Animals, shoe others, and prepare for our further progress to Mazatlan. The two divisions with others joined in order to leave Potosi together, so as to make a display of arms, as we were informed that 70 armed guerrillas had preceeded us to the mountain passes in order to rob us, as it was currently reported here that we were in posession of a large amount of gold, and going to California to remain. It is well known that a large population of robbers live in San Louis Potosi, whose chief business is to watch and rob travellers, which makes robberies every day affairs in this country. The Mexican Indian population of this part of the Republic, seeing the monopolies of the government, have rebelled and endeavored to first down the present government with that pretext, and at the same time committing gross outrages and robberies under that cloak, by themselves. I am not aware of any Hotel in the American style existing in the whole city of San Louis, Masons or public houses exist there, which consists of squarefor at least a half mile upon the pass, No 33. is a hasty sketch taken offhand in passing a part of this interesting valley, having a large gravel bed in the foreground No 34. is a sketch of curious mountain looking west, from the summet of a gently sloping prairie hill, after having ascended from the narrow passes, and large hills on the east to this much more elevated country. In the afternoon we came upon an extensive open prairie with a gentle slope of miles, without timber and covered with parched grass, so that there was no shade, with an abundance of dust flying in considerable clouds. Several times during the day, Mexicans, richly dressed, and well mounted upon firey steeds, would ride into our ranks, bow politely, talk for a time, and then disappear, we judged them to be the guerrilla spies, and took good care to show them our determination and strength of arms. Just before sunset we arrived at the Hacienda of Tepetate, the proprietor being hostile to the Americans, would not permit us to occupy the Mason, so that we were compelled to camp out not withstanding the night proved to be very cold; we raised our camp fires, and soon prepared excellent though plain suppers, which took their usual round in messes. A strict guard was set, and the1849. March. night passed off without molestation, although anticipated before sunset I took sketch No 35 of Tepetate Hacienda. (Monday)  26th  Day clear and warm. Commenced March this morning at 6. O clock. The scenery ahead was extensive, pretty, and interesting. Several of our men were on the  sick list to day, but nothing very serious, except one man who had his arm broken some days back of San Louis Potosi, but he is now rapidly improving. Our journey today extended 18 leagues, the same as yesterday and one horse lost on this days' march, on every day event with the numerous trains on this route to Gaudalaxara. During the day we passed over a hilly country and  then upon a gently rolling country covered with immense fields of wild cactus, prickly pears, and other thorny plants usually from 5 to 10 feet in height, and often extending thus as far as the eye could reach, without any relief of other plants, &c. I found some pretty specimens of Chalcedony by the way. At evening we arrived at the Hacienda of Novelia, about 100 miles from Potosi. A pretty green valley was spread out on the right, and a similar valley to the left, whilst we descended upon the rocky side of the hill as inNo. 36 into the right hand valley facing the southwest, we camped again in front of a Mason, and they were still hostile towards us. At night a cloud dark as Egypt rol'd o'er us from the North West, with a short but heavy shower, accompanied with heavy thunder and lightning. Our baggage escaped by being carried under shelter, and we passed a very uncomfortable night. About eleven at night when darkness reigned in blackness, a noise like stampeeding or stealing  our horses and mules took place. 7 or 8 of our party immediately proceeded to search for the intruders with loaded arms, but found none there except our mule drivers; An hour after some alarm was created by hearing about 40, reports similar to the firing of guns in quick succession over in the next valley; we were however ready for any guerrillas or other intruders, but they did not trouble us further, as we fired salutes a number of times which echoed along the valley like sober precautions. [*Tuesday 27th*] Day clear and warm. Commenced our march at 6. O. clock, and crossed extensive open, dusty, and hot prarie plains. By eight in the morning the Sun generally gets warm and quite hot by nine, which continues until the customary evening breeze springs up from 12 to 5. O. clock.About noon we passed a romantic village where I sketched the church in No 37. but did not think to learn the name of the village as I was much in the rear when I drew it, besides being attacked by a noisy pack of wolfish dogs. To day we began to find plenty of palatable fruit upon the prickley pear plants that were very abundant on our way; which became more ripened as we advanced. We passed around the base of a lofty and barren rocky mountain into a magnificent valley, where could be seen many handsome Haciendos, ranches little lakes walled up, with strong stone breastwork, extensive fields under good cultivation, some of which were irigated by fresh running streams, woodlands, a small meandering river, orange-groves, and other marks of civilization, besides another long and very beautiful village, along a broad and shady road, very unlike what we had seen since leaving San Louis Potosi. It was really an extensive or far reaching valley of civilization handsome ranches, and a garden spot, among the barren praries and mountains of Central Mexico. Rabbits (with long ears and) of uncommon size, were very plentiful, 7 and 8 have been started at a time, of course we made some fine meals from them; A fine fresh breeze blows yet each afternoon from the Gulf of Mexico but in a few more days we are told that it will blow from the Pacific Ocean, towards the east each afternoon at the same time though opposite to that from the Gulf of Mexico. Before Sun set we landed at a rancho called \"San Nicholas\" a dilapidated rancho unlike much of this fine valley which I sketched as in Number 38. here some of our party were in to bathe, though the water was cold, being considerably elevated; water mellons, eggs, &c. were abundant and cheap, and the mellons of excellent quality. Notwithstanding we might here occupy rooms in a  Mason, yet most of our party preferred sleeping out in the open air, although it was somewhat cool at night. At this place there is a small church, which from the peculiarly rude paintings of Deer &c upon it, I would judge to be very ancient among modern things; it has however a flat roof, which is the customary Mexican fashion of building, except where they have become partially Americanized.Wedned. 28th. Day clear and warm. Commenced our march at 6. O. clock for a short days travel of only 15 miles to the beautiful city of San Maria Del Lagos, which is located down the same handsome and fertile valley as before described. Our road was broad, well setled, and abounded with shade, water, and pretty scenery, whilst we were most of the time in full view of the two opposite mountain ranges of barrenness on each side of this pleasant valley of groves and gardens. We entered Lagos city, over a small but handsome stone bridge, by a broad road, quite equal to some of our American McAdamized roads, and of very pretty and romantic scenery. We entered in double file with the pack mules ahead as usual, and presented quite a line of a military face, as each had his coat off, exhibiting uniformly red flannels, and plenty of well kept arms. Multitudes gazed upon us with apparently great surprise and curiosity, to which we have now become accostomed. After winding about for some time along the various streets, &c, we at last came to quarters in the \"Mason De Merce.\" Crowds soon surrounded our wide spreading archway,to sell us mellons, oranges, sweetmeats, etc. &c. In company  with a friend I visited the Market plaza, where I  purchased a fine cantelope for a Quartelia a 3 ct. piece,  a bowl of buttermilk for a Tolacco, 1 1/2 ct. piece. A good  water mellon for a Quartee, 3 cts. a box of excellent  preserves for a Tolacco, 1 cent and a half, and a good  bowl of coffee for a Madeau or 6 1/4 cts. This is the  only place where I ever saw Ice cream for sale. A number of delicious fruits crowded this market, that  we never see in the States, some of which we found  wild along our road. Near the Market there is a  fine large public plaza, well built up with stones  of the first class, with shade trees, many good seats,  and a handsome fountain in the centre. On the North  side of this plaza there stands one among the most  noble and massive Sanctuaries of Mexico, and usually  ranked among her chief churches, which I  endeavored to sketch as in No. 39. it is build of a hard  light red sand stone approaching a cream color; I did  not obtain its dimensions, but it is certainly larger than  any church which I have ever seen in the States, and  in workmanship equal to the finest church of New York.It rises in Lagos like an immense collosal pile, a great monument of perseverance and skill,. It has been erected about 40 years, and towers above the city like St Peters' at Rome. The interior is still more splendid than its exterior, gorgeous displays of wealth, immense gothic works in gold and  silver leaf, are suspended from the far off ceiling, an organ, richly decorated is supported by a beautiful and curiously formed gallery, Pilasters of great height trimmed with silver leaf, rise between and separate very large and brilliant paintings. Statues, here and there decorated with costly dresses, gems, &c occupy their several positions whilst the chief  Altar is a piece of work of great expense and  magnificense, [whilst] and a high arching dome throws its many color'd lights down upon the rich counter colors of the chief Altar, and gives to the whole a peculiarly beautiful appearance. Bells of great magnitude (originally from Spain) toll at various hours of the day in concert with the other church bells of the city. By permission I ascended the only tower in which the great bells are suspended, andfrom that massive stone cupola, I sketched scene No 40.  looking south west over a portion of that fertile  valley before described, and a part of the city of Lagos,  including several fine churches, and the nunnery &c, showing two important table mountains in the distance, the present bed of the river, which is now nearly dry, and the flat rooves of the city; with a small part of the public plaza. This is the most interesting section for a view out of four, as it comprehends only about 1/4th of the city, and time would not permit me to sketch any others in this interesting city. The delay of a half day at Lagos was occasioned by our horses and mules requiring some improvements in shoeing, thus affording me a short period for sketching. This town includes about 12 thousand inhabitants, and is apparently a thrifty and stirring place of considerable neatness and beauty, though in places antiquated. This afternoon at 2.O.clock, a party of 7 Americans and 5 Frenchmen arrived here from Verra Cruz, and the city of Mexico. They met with troubles and dangers by the way, and were very glad to join in with our company in going to Mazatlan, which a part of them did in dangerous times.[*Thorsd 29th*] Day clear and warm. Commenced our march this morning at 6.O.clock, for the beautiful city of \"San Juan Del Lagos,\" a place of about 7 thousand inhabitants, and about 12 leagues distant from the former. More than half the days march was over a dry and barren country. We approached within a very short distance of the town, before discovering it, as it was  situated in a narrow and very deep valley, and hardly discovered until we had got nearly over it, when we descended a paved road directly into the city of life, and dense crowds of curious spectators. The scenery of this deep and narrow valley, with its meandering  water course, and the distant mountains, was peculiarly  barren and wild; but the town had pleasant orange groves, gardens, &c, with shady walks and fountains here and there and a very handsome plaza, upon which  was the largest and finest Sanctuary we had yet seen even surpassing in magnitude the one last seen,  this was indeed a stupendeous pile of human art and perseverance; a sign informed us that its age exceeded 100, years, and it was yet in an excellent state of preservation. In front of this grand Sanctuary therewas a handsome fountain in the centre of a public plaza, surrounded by seats and in a circle of small Allamo trees. Most of the houses were highly ornamented with various colored devices, whilst rows of massive collonades, made the plaza scene quite agreeable, which was very much crowded by the inhabitants, and the market plaza was in its immediate vicinity. No. 41 is a sketch of the grand Sanctuary of \"San Juan Del Lagos.\" in magnitude and external beauty it exceeds the other at San Maria  Del Lagos, but in its interior magnificense it is about the same though still more expansive. The floor of the interior is inlaid with porcelain of China of various colors of chequered work; and the same upon the outer surface of the great dome. The workmanship of the steeples (which are very high) is considered inferior to none in all Mexico, certainly I never before saw any similar work equal to them, either in Mexico, Canada or the States. Time would scarcely permit a careful sketch of this massive edifice, and night closed upon me without my being able to get others from other positions, of fountains, churches, and a view of the city &c. As our party left early next morning no time of course was available for further sketches.[*Fridy. 30th*] Day clear and warm, Commenced our march at half past six O.clock, crossing a large and costly stone bridge, the handsomest and largest I had yet seen in Mexico; it was handsome and built entirely of a light hard free stone; toll was paid in crossing it. a paved road wound around and up the hill in a serpentine form until it reached the summet, from which there was a splendid view of the town, river, churches, groves, &c; we passed from this pleasant view into another very steep, deep, and narrow valley; from which we arose again to follow a rolling barren country of prarie hills, covered here and there with fragments of loose broken rocks, and much broken chalcedony. An Alcalde with Lady, &c. has accompanied our train for several days, keeping near us, and travelling in a regular Mexican carriage drawn by 6 mules, four of which travel abreast, with a driver sitting upon one of them, the whole affair appeared clumsy. He usually stopped at the same Masons with our company; he was evidently travelling under our  protection from Ladrones or robbers, as the Mail and several Mexican gentlemen were then dooing.about 9.O. clock this morning a body of 3 or 4 hundred Mexican soldiers passed us, followed by many women and children, the whole of whoom were on foot except their officers. At the head of one of their companies was an Irish Deserter who addressed us in the usual language of contempt whilst a number of the soldiers spoke to us in Spanish and a little in the English. They were bound for Rio Verdy, a town of importance towards Tampico, in order to put down Queros and his party, who were opposed to the Government of Herrara. During the after part of this day we passed over an extensive country of open rolling and barren praries, exhibiting scarcely any thing else but rocks, gullies, parched grass and in places an abundance of dust. At evening we landed at an old dilapidated rancho, where provisions were scarce and dear; the name of this rancho was \"Lavent,\" which I sketched and No 42, at sunset. [*Sat. 31st*] Day clear and warm. Commenced our march this morning at half past six O. clock, having only 7 leagues for the day For the first time, we now passed through a valley of gentle undulations, having a very red soil, that  was under cultivation, and appearing to be productive, along the valley there was about a half mile to the right,a high hill appearing very much like an old dilapidated pyramid, which was the opinion of several who saw it. During this mornings march, we passed through several small villages of scattering mud cabins, inhabited as usual by Mexican Indians. About 1.O.clock we descended a paved road into a broad ravine, and after crossing a bridge ascended upon the side of a low spreading hill into the town of Tepatillan, where we remained until the following morning as it was too far to the next rancho for the day. Before night [nigh], I sketched the church as in No. 43. the age of which is nearly a century and a half. It is a plain building, very large, and of an Antiquated appearance. This town contains about 6 thousand inhabitants; having a neat and pleasant appearance about the plaza, and chief streets. The walks of the plaza are all followed by ranges of very large and spreading shade trees resembling the Oak though more expansive. In the centre of this plaza there is a handsome fountain, and on the South Side of it, the town market, and opposite under a long colonade where the Alcalde's office was located. A young man from the States, was arrested [here] by some Frenchmen andimprisoned here on a charge of stealing two hundred  dollars, which he protested against strongly. Most of  our company visited him, and by much taking with  the Alcalde had him taken from a miserable cell  of crowded polution, and placed in better quarters,  we could not get him released, and had to leave him  at the mercy of his enraged enemies, and the Alcalde  believing him to be innocent of that charge, although  he frankly acknowledged having stolen 60 dollars  in Mexico, whilst in distress. Upon which acknowledgement  the Alcalde made out his commitment. The  Frenchmen (we were afterward told.) Said they would  wait until the Americans had left, when by some  means they would get him out, and kill him in the  mountains. The whole appeared like a sad affair. I felt sorry for the young man for we could not  render him assistance without endangering our own  liberty. The feelings of the whole American Company  were against the Frenchmen, who treated him with  severe abuse. He was a delicate young man of about 20.  and said that he had left a widow'd mother and a  sister in the States, and he pointed to a ring on hisfinger, and said that this was the only token of theirs now in his possession, and that at night in his cell, the Mexicans had wrench'd his finger repeatedly to get it. If he escapes, it will be by some miracle unknown to wiley Frenchmen, and stupid Mexicans. This evening the host passed around the plaza drawn in his superb carriage, with the usual ceremonies. April Sund 1st Day clear and warm. Commenced our march at an early hour. The first part of the day we passed over a rolling and barren woodless country, with mountains in the distance. In the afternoon we descended into a lower country a large valley extending many miles and somewhat of a triangular  form as in No 44. In this valley a stream meandered along which in places woodlands appeared. At one place on a low and spreading hill, beside this stream, was located a very romantic and beautiful little town, the admiration of all our company. It appeared to be one forest of very tall orange trees, with bushels beside bushels laying thickly strewn upon the ground in almost every direction with small and neat cabins scattered here and there through these extensive groves. Most of the orange trees  were over 20 feet in height, much resembling largeapple orchards. Among the rest of the pleasant things to be observed here, was a cool and refreshing mountain spring of considerable size rushing rapidly in various branches down the quick descents of several of its streets. Shaded by palms, cactus, orange groves and shrubbery, We passed in sight of the plaza; where I saw a neat looking church. About 4 or 5 miles from this village we passed through another, less shaded, beside the same stream, and near a fair looking stone bridge. Still continuing in this long valley, just before sunset, we came to a river of good size, and descending a long slope lined on either side with Mexican cabins, from a  large mason on the hill, down upon a very large and antiquated stone bridge, upon which were four square towers, upon two of which were statues of the King and Queen of Spain, with an inscription beneath nearly obliterated by time, upon the other two towers were statues of monks or fathers. we crossed this large bridge and put up at a mason on the opposite side in the little town of Tolololotlan, after passing up a street of cabins of more than a mile in length, we found our Mason. I then proceeded in company down to thebeautiful banks of the Rio Grande or San Antonio, and sketched  the great bridge as in No 45, looking north from  above on the west bank of this interesting stream. On the opposite or North side of the bridge of  Tolololotlan, the whole river pitches over large  masses of rocky boulders with a heavy lumbering  roar that can be heard for several miles before  reaching it; above it spreads out to a considerable  width dotted here and there promiscuously with  small and interesting islands, with green meadows  rolling hills, and the lofty blue mountains, all of which  forms a highly picturesque scene, which I endeavored  to sketch as in No 46. On first beholding this fine  little river, it may naturally be supposed that we  rejoiced at the first sight of a stream that emptied  into the great Pacific Ocean, and it seem'd to make  us feel that a part of our great journey to California  via Mexico would soon draw the land chapters  to a grateful close. On the following morning by early light  I sketched a part of the interior of our Mason as in sketch 47.  where the earthen flower jars were plentifully ranged  around the tops of our mason columns, containing  shrubs &c.1849. April. At this place we fell in company with a small New York party  of 8 or 10 persons, and learned from them, that one of  their party had been shot in the head by accident and  killed instantly, it happened at a bridge not far from this  place; the father of the deceased was present in the same company. Mond 2nd Day clear and warm. Commenced our march at 6.O.clock for 8 leagues. Passed through a small cove, and then upon a high plane  where there was a considerable pond or small lake, and  afterwards crossed a deep ravine upon a stone bridge by a  small village, a place noted for robberies &c. and from thence  proceeded over a hilly and picturesque prarie country until  we ascended a considerable ridge, in company with a very  large burthen train of miles for the great city just ahead. On descending this slope into a somewhat lower country  a distant view of Gaudalaxhara, broke upon us as in  sketch 47. which I hastily copied by the way, being then  within about 6 miles of the city and looking North west. Before arriving at Gaudalaxhara, at 4 miles distant, we  passed through a small town of a very pleasant appearance  in which there was the remains of a once superb sanctuary. A handsome shaded plaza with a curious fountain,  and a tall and handsome dragon fountain at the North west  suburbs of the town,on this plaza sweet meats, lemonade, and other  mild drinks with Polka, a drink sweeter than cider, with oranges, mellons, bannannas, and other fruits were very abundant and cheap. the exhibition of which presented quite a pretty appearance as they were promiscuously ranged about the fountain plaza beneath the broad spreading shade trees. From the suburbs of this town to the suburbs of Gaudalaxhora, there is a broad Mc Adamized road 3 miles in length, with 4 rows of spreading shade trees, principally of the Allamo with others of very great magnitude, as in sketch  No 48. extending its whole length, thus dividing two pleasant and shady walks on both sides of the principal road, which was about 50 feet in width, about 100 feet including each walk, this road with its neighboring scenery and a distant inkling of the city presented quite a pretty and interesting appearance. We entered the city in double file, with pack mules in the advance. The suburbs appeared very extensive, and it was at least one hour before we reached our Mason, as we seem'dGaudalaxhara. continually winding hither and thither, among a continuous crowd of strange brown faces and peculiar scenes. Having arrived in one of the handsomest and greatest cities of all Mexico, I hastened to avail myself of every opportunity to explore and discover its fine arts &c. In entering we passed 4 or 5 very handsome public edifices but time would not permit me to sketch them except in a  general view. an aqueduct of water, at first mistaken for a regular canal with stone bridges, abutments and its handsomely finished breast works crosses the southern part of the city proper, along it there are shady walks of trees great Magnitude and age, with fountains in shady places,  and fruit plazas in various directions; watermellons were vastly abundant, and cheap, piles of them were seen on almost every little plaza, where any fruit might be sold. As near as I could ascertain the population of Gaudalaxhara, was about One hundred and seventy five thousand which I believe is about the correct estimate, as it appears much larger than Baltimore, M.D. April. Tuesd 3rd Day warm & clear. Our company concluded to remain in this fine city over this day to proceed early on the morrow. Of course I saw and sketched as much as possible. [*31*]The city is very regularly laid out in right angle streets, usually from 20 to 40 feet in width public gardens and several fine plazas, besides market squares variously. It is considered more than twice as large as San Louis Potosi, and the most beautiful of all the cities of this Republic, and second only to the city of Mexico in size. It is located in an interesting valley, and surrounded by barren mountains in the distance, and elevated several thousand feet above the level of the Ocean. A part of the valley about it is under very good cultivation and presents an extensive and civilized appearance. Every thing combined with a pleasant breezy afternoon, such as we had on entering Gaualaxhara, - a prettier scene could scarcely be found in any of the Northern States of Mexico. It is much admired and spoken of by all travelers who have visited it. Its communications with other towns is conducted entirely by mules, and horses, and all goods carried upon the pack saddles of mules. So that the main roads leading each way from the city, is almost constantly crowded for miles beyond the reach of the eye, with thousands of horsemen, and pack mules, going and returning in large companies.Near this city such scenes are really so animating that it would seem almost incredible were the number at one single view given. Dust is of course very plentiful During this day I visited many parts of the city, the interior of several splendid churches, public buildings, gardens, cemetaries &c. The main plaza, is the most splendid of all that I have yet seen in (all of) Mexico, and said to be handsomer than that of the city of Mexico. It is in the form of a square, followed by Allamo shade trees upon each side, with neat seats, and a handsome fountain in the center. The buildings which surround it are of the first class, and bear much resemblance to all the old Spanish edifices of Spain. The streets which Surround it, for nearly a mile in every direction, exhibit great displays of wealth, fashion, business, and refinement. There is a custom much used here, of covering the pavements with long and massive collonades of one and occasionally two stories in height. Almost every house, building, or edifice, excepting the finest sanctuaries, have the usual flat rooves, and generally a very massive appearance, somewhat similar to Egyptian customs. [*52*]Here strange scenes and strange brown faces, that - densely throng the plazas, markets, groves, [and] fountains, and beneath the long and massive colonnades, makes the American feel at once his absence from home, and his isolated position among the most strange of foreign countries. Strange customs, ceremonies, dress, and modes of living seems to transplanted you at once into another and different world. Go where you will, you are a stranger, and a strange object of gaping curiosity, even to the Soldiers in the Official Pallaces, who would treat you respectfully with small presents of fruits, and politeness, and permit you to intrude on forbidden ground, whilst a common mexican for the same intrusion without a permit, might find a sharp whack upon his callabash the consequence. Among the litterati and official circles of this city there is certainly less hostility to the Americans, than among the illitterate, half Indian, and Servile population, and those on the way back to San Louis Potosi. On the main plaza, there stands an immense Sanctuary of great dimensions and magnificense: It occupies asquare of itself including a grand wing called the Cathedral, as in No. 49. The chief building under the larger dome being called the Sagrario, all of which is now being repaired and repainted with superb interior displays. It is the grand Sanctuary of this city and among its finest buildings for interior displays, which are immensely grand and very elegant; gems, Saints in splendid attire, magnificent Altars, Organs, paintings, large immages apparently cast in gold, over the Altars, inlaid porcelain, work, stained glass of various  colors, beautiful silken draperies, massive silver ornaments, gothic columns, and gothic domes gilt with gold and silver leaf, until the whole glittered by the evening lights like some fabulous golden palace for beings above the common things of mortality. No such scenes of granduer can yet be found in the States, and I have been repeatedly surprised at the enormous wealth, which must have been lavished upon these religious pallaces in Mexico. judging from the time, and immense labor required in their completion; and in their superior pieces of Sculpture, Architecture, and paintings, with their mammoth bells, and [*53*]fine toned Organs, superior castings, elegant designs, drapery, massive granduer, orders of Architecture, and fine materials, which at this day, far exceeds the small and half civilized capacities of the original Mexican inhabitants. From Spain all this display of wealth, &c has originated, been cast, planed, carved, painted, and then transplanted upon the planes, vallies, and mountains of Mexico, and there set up profusely all over the land in immense colosal monuments, whilst Mexico was under that Government. From this beautiful plaza I proceeded towards the aquaduct Southward, where getting upon the flat top of a Mexican Mason or public house, I sketched scene No 50. looking North East, towards some of the mountain ranges, and over the prettiest part of Gaudalaxhara, which I selected from the four views, showing a part of the aquaduct a fine large church, a part of the Hospital in the distance and a fine long park. The principal part of the city rises upon a broad and gentle undulation to the left of this aqueduct, the face of which is dotted here and there with handsomepublic edifices as in this view (No. 50). I then  proceeded to a fine public garden about a mile  from this location, in which I took sketch No. 51. I suppose that it covered about 8 acres, being larger  than any of the squares of Philada. In the centre  of it there was a large fountain, from which fine  walks passed off in each direction. Shade trees  of great magnitude covered the square, whilst the beds were full of beautiful shrubs in full  bloom, which on entering presented to us the appearance of a beautiful shady grove richly and  closely carpeted with many species of flowers  so ingeniously interwoven as to show the  figgure of one large flower by the shades of  those planted together. This I have seen  in many places through Mexico. In this garden  there was a fine large revolving swing with 4 seats,  similar to those in the States. This was a large and  very beautiful garden and appeared to be a place of fashionable  resort. From this place I proceeded towards  the aqueduct and sketched a curious fountain in  the long park as in No. 52. From this fountain [*54*]I proceeded about two miles to the northern suburbs,  and passing several beautiful churches of curious  Architecture, I came to a large enclosed Square, which  proved to be a cemetery; apparently of recent origin.  in the center of this square [was] I sketched No 53.  which is a handsomely ornamented and chequered frame with two interior apportuents which were  beautifully ornamented and richly decorated within  No 54 is a sketch of a beautiful freestone monument in the same enclosure. Directly facing No 53, and at  the opposite end of the same pavement I sketched  the grand collonade building as in No 55. each of those  square chambers along it are intended for two or more  coffins, the door of which being closed has upon the outer side the usual inscription of the tombstone. Day light prevented further sketches , though I would have taken many more if the opportunities would have  permitted. The market plazas were located in  several parts of the city, and were crowded to  excess with watermelons and other fruits. and on  one plaza exceeding any thing I had ever seen in  Mexico, and a most beautiful sight too, as everythingwas very tastefully arranged, even to the different colors of Lemonades, &c. Many fruits were abundant here that are never seen in the States.  most of which are sold at reasonable prices. After leaving the cold winter of the States and comming so suddenly into hot weather, dust, mellons, and oceans of fruit amid a Summer heat in Mexico  you may well suppose that we are quite sensible of this change; whilst we often remarked to each other, that our relatives at home little thought that we were now feasting upon the  finest mellons in the world, whilst the cold winds of winter were whistling around their homes. I doo not think that there are more churches here than in San Louis Potosi, notwithstanding this is so much longer than the former city of Potosi. I visited several fine churches, but had no  time to sketch even a small part of the great beauties I saw during even this one day. Though vehicles of any kind were seldom seen through  the country, yet heavy carriages of a clumsey - [*55*]   appearance for the aristocracy and the Priests were quite plentifull in townThe americans still continue to arrive in this city, 40 more during this day from Mexico. Wed 4th. Day clear and warm. Commenced our march at 6.O. clock. On leaving the city, we passed the walls of an extensive prison, which was being erected of stone, at the North Western suburbs. The road was broad, very much crowded, and almost one continued cloud of dust for many miles out of the city. About four miles on the way we passed a neat little village, with a magnificent Sanctuary or public edifice, therein of enormous dimensions and square walls enclosing some 8 or 10 acres, with very high (18 or 20 feet) iron railing in front which was ornamented and gilt, and ranging a full square between delicate pillars and light arches of stone. Some of our party supposed that it was the Bishop's Palace. About 12 miles from the city we passed a tall gate; it was a high stone gate crossing the road in one arch about 35 feet in height with a large Mason, and a few scattering huts about it. After this our road wound aroud large hills, deep ravines, through several narrow passes, and for the first time in a great distance, among numerous large pines, oak bushes, &c ranging over desolate looking hills.At about 20 miles from Gaudalaxhara, I made a hasty sketch  looking west as in No 56. showing the mountains and a small part of the lower valley country, which is somewhat below  the valley of the city we have just left. This is a celebrated  part of the country for Robberies, and we were even told in Gaudlaxhara, that two hundred, Ladrones or  Robbers had left that city the night before us, on our way  to cut us off at about 30 miles out. We did not however regard it, knowing the veracity of Mexican reports  which generally had some other crafty object in view. At about 22. or 23 miles from the city, we came upon an open prarie of rolling or undulating knolls, a part of which had them been recently burned off, on this black charry and dismal looking place, there stood  a large and high gallows, upon which were suspended  the bodies of three Robber chiefs; they had been suspended  there about 3 weeks, and were ghastly looking objects, bullet holes preforated their dried bodies in many  places which were nearly ready to drop to the earth.  over them was a large painted Sign, as follows -  \"Thus the Law punishes the Robber and the Assassin\". Only a few weeks before we arrived here these men [*56*]were chief actors in some bloody deeds, about this place, until some of the government troops overtook them with the justice they merited. The number of these Robbers are said to have been about 200 strong, committing  constant depridations and murders upon travellers and many of the regular Mexican baggage trains. This scene was to melancholy a picture to sketch, so that I left it for a more fit object and about 3. miles further west, as in sketch No 57. I copied a peculiar mountain and small village, to the right of which our road continued its torturous course. In the afternoon as we descended into a third interesting valley, our mountain scenery became extensive, very lofty, and peculiarly wild, moreso than we had yet seen them. Upon the right and upon the left were seen towering mountains, with immense barren cliffs above cliffs, and their numerous rugged woodless spears rising high in the air like collosal ruins of pyramids of yet untold of magnitude. To the west this great triangular valley tapered to our interesting focus, at the far point of which the sun was setting amid a few light and beautiful clouds.whilst the mountains diminished gradually as they receded in the background, all of which formed quite an intersting and beautiful landscape view though very wild. We then descended a hill into the lower valley, and took quarters for the night in a mason, beside the church on the market plaza of the town of Amattitan, being about 40 miles from Gaudalaxhara. Before dark I ascended a high precipice of rocks east of the market plaza, and sketched No 58. showing the square, the big walled spring facing the market, part of the church, part of the town of Amattitan, with its shade trees, with a part of the valley, and the mountains on the western horizon. Here we found plenty of mellons and other fruits all which were quite cheap. Our company here numbered over fifty. A part of them sat by moonlight under the broad archway of the gate of our mason, until 9. O. clock singing in concert, the national songs of America, some 60 or 70 Mexicans, crowded around them seemingly much delighted. About 9.O. clock a Mexican having stolen a purse, from Mr Hassan, was persued and shot at by him, which scattered the rest in short metre.The Alcalde, called next morning and commeded Mr Hassans' course, by saying that he wished Mr H. had killed the thief; it appears that he was wounded, but got off with the bead purse. We were informed at Gaudalaxhara, that this town was, and had been a celebrated rendezvous for the mountain Robbers. &c. [*Thurs'd. 5th*] Day warm and clear. Left Amattitan by early sun rise, and continued our march North west across the valley, among rolling hills of gentle slopes, having small rancho's here and there at short periods; this days road was peculiarly interesting in its scenery we saw to day many fields of the maguay plant ranging over many gentle hills, and upon some of the few fertile spots along the wild mountains base. They make a mild drink from it called  Polka, also the Ardiente, which is stronger than  whiskey, which I believe is made from the magauy also. About 11.O. clock A.M. we passed through Tekelah a town of some importance, noting perhaps 4000 inhabitants. It had a fine shady plaza, upon which stood a very large and antiquated church. On the plaza, fruit appeared in great abundance, andgoing through their usual ceremonies. fruits were abundant and 18, oranges were  bought here for a Madeau or 6 1/4 cts. Orange groves compose the  chief shade of the town. Several very large springs or rather small creeks, breakout of the hills east of the town square, and meander in rapid streams through several of the streets. The water was of a slightly milky cast, and an unpalatable limestone taste. At night the moon rose full and clear, with an occasional flitting cloud, and a gentle breeze. This night a band of 40 Mexicans, all [each] well armed with muskets, pistols, swords, and knives; - presented themselves in double file at the gate of our Mason, or Hotel; and demanded quarters there for the night. Our landlord believing them to be robbers told us to prepare our arms for service, which we did in a few minutes. The Landlord then told them through their captain, that his apartments were all full, and that they could not have quarters in his Mason, to which their captain answered that they would come in in defiance of him and those within. The gate of the Mason which was very broad, and of one expansive arch; the doors of which being open, the Robbers drew themselves up in a compact body immediately before it on the pavement and street. Our landlord stepping forward told them that they must wait a short time until he could see further about his accomodations. But he immediately passed out by another way from his Mason, in pursuit of the Alcalde of the town, who in a short time came with him to our quarters. The Alcalde enquired of their captain who they were, where from be. They answered that they were government soldiers; He then demanded of their captain, their passport as government soldiers, - but they could show none besides the said company acknowledged having travelled on two days, which by the laws of Mexico, no government troops, are permitted to travel. By their dress superabundance of arms, and statements the Alcalde judged them to be a band of ladrones or Robbers, following us, and not improbable that they were a detachment of a larger body, sent in town as government troops, in order to stop overnight in the walls of our Hotel to take us by surpriseand most probably after stealing our arms, then to attack the town, which is a common occurrence in many parts of Mexico. The Alcalde told us that he believed them to be Robbers. He evidently feared them. He told us to see that our arms were all in order and ready for execution in case we were attacked. Its a matter of course all our men were prompt in self defence, and with our guns, pistols, and knives, in hand and about us, we drew up in order, compactly before the door, facing the Robbers, who stood quietly facing and viewing us as mute as a posse of terrified owls; the Alcalde and our landlord refused them admittance into our Mason, but they would have entered by force had not our company presented a bolder front, headed by Capt Grant, of Philadelphia; who told them that they should not enter, except at the peril of their lives, at the same time every trigger was ready to tell. A moment of suspense, and they decamped in quick step up to the town plaxa, where they were permitted to stay by the authorities. After this the Alcalde came several times to ourquarters, telling us to put on extra guards, which we did, even upon the high walls, in order to stand sentinel over our horses as well as our other property, and persons. The Alcalde told us that there was a probability of either our company or the town being attack'd during the night, and wished us to promise that in case the town was attack'd by them, to assist the citizens and his little military force in putting down the Robbers, which we promised, and on the other hand he told us that if the attack should be directed first towards us, his people should assist us, but that we must not mistake and fire upon a religious procession of the citizens which would pass our Mason about 3 O. clock in the morning. This was an evening long to be remembered from many circumstances. It was a most beautiful moonlight night, and now and then a gentle breeze played fitfully from the beautiful lake of Madalena; My turn among the sentinels came from 12 to 2 O clock in the morning; and my positions around the high walls, and the expansive enclosed yards, was pleasant and romantic during so pleasant a night as this; seeming at times like a dream, that I were facing therounds of some ancient castle and looking down among the  dark shades of the groves around slumbering in silence beneath the full and magic moon. I stood upon the house top, meditating upon the beautiful Lake of Madalena, the mountains, standing off in deep shadows, the many flat rooves, the groves and the rocky cliffs near the town; about 2. O. clock a procession of the citizens took place; proceeding from the church and passed our Mason. It was headed by richly robed priests, who were chanting solemn airs; a full sized wax figure of our Savior, of full size, clothed in mourning with a crown of thorns, representing Him as passing up to Mount Calvary, whilst before Him were carried several hundred candles, with several hundred Mexican ladies following each with candles, accompanied with an excellent band of music, the whole was a peculiar scene. Before day light those Ladrones or Robbers before named had all disappeared, having preceeded us on our road through a formidable mountain and vastly grand ravine country, of deep cavernous valleys, suiting such a class of beings.1849 April 6th bay warm and clear. Commenced our march at  half past six o clock, winding our way around that beautiful and interesting lake of Madalena. Formidable mountains appeared in full view and an immense country of sugar loaf hills, sharp peaks, several hundred of which might be seen at one view from elevated positions, at times we passed over a graded road, upon which considerable pains had been taken, about 10 A.M. we descended into a very deep and curious valley of about two miles in width, passing down which it spread out to higher rolling hills with very deep chasms for water passing around these hills and amongst them variously. About 12  meridian I sketched Scene No 63 which was a large Hacienda, westward appeared very large mountains, between which and the Hacienda one several tortuous ravines, the deepest and most awfully grand that I ever saw, being more like immense caverns than ravines. through which we passed about 15 miles. They are called the \"Baranca's\". a road descends upon the  almost perpendicular face of one of them, which is very tortuous and romantic; as you might see the train quite beneath us.winding their way far down the deep cavernous  valley of the Baranca's; as in No 64. with high and  barren Mountains, sparcely timbered towering far above  these numerous deep Barancas. Passing along these  deep narrow vallies, we crossed several times a rapid  creek of some magnitude, over which in many places  high brown rocky cliffs, and various timbers,  bend gracefully over its romatic and noisy waters. No 65. is a sketch passing down the creek in this valley. No 66. do a short distance north west of the former sketch,   with high frowning bluffs of brown rocks. No 67. is another  passing father down the stream, where the road ascends  and again descends to the creek; after fording which  upon rocks [upon] from which the water was bounding  away rapidly; we ascended upon the opposite side,  where a small race of water descended to a pleasant  little dwelling, about which fine timber, several  species of very high cactus, and underbrush with luxuriant  grass were seen forming a highly picturesque  and romantic view. But our train passed so rapidly  that I was much in the rear with my last sketches,  and had to omit this pretty scene for one whichfollowed shortly after as in sketch no 68 where we came to  the junction of apparently three triangular vallies, or deep passes of the Barancas, and the junction of the two fine streams of fair water. At this place there was a pleasant Rancho over the creek, with little groves of oaks, pines, cactus, Bannannas, and beautiful green meadows. Our train turned round and up the left hand valley. And presently  came to scene as in No 69, very high, barren, and steep mountains of almost no timber, arose high in the air, with slight misty clouds around their summets; upon the side of one of them a road was seen ascending which is a view of a part of a graded road, cut over this great mountain by some foreigners at an immense cost, and in most places blown through the solid rock, and of excellent workmanship. In this little valley there was a mill of some kind in operation with a large horizontal wheel. I was afterwards told for the purpose of washing out the silver ore beneath the road, seen on the mountainside, there is a small and pleasant village, in which there is an abundance of fine fruits and surrounded by extensive green fields, meadows, groves, and fine timbers along the stream that meanders through its valley, that spreads  out to a ---triangular cove, dotted with several pleasant Rancho's, No 70. is a sketch taken on entering this pleasant cove where the village was located. After leaving the village we commenced ascending the mountain road. Time would not permit me to sketch as much as I desired, No 71. shows the workmanship on our fine road over, one of the most formidable mountains in Mexico, it is cut out of the rocks, and walled paved and graded thus all the way up this mountain for a distance of six miles. and as great a piece of work of its kind, as any that I know of in the U States of America. No 72. is another sketch farther up this fine road. The view from the Summet of this mountain looking eastward was fine indeed; including many a green and beautiful valley and more mountains, peaks, knolls, hills, vallies, dales, coves, and verdant spots, blended with wildness and prarie hills, than I had ever yet seen in all Mexico; and was really grand beyond description. The mountains far east about Gaudalaxhara could be seen like smoky shadows of deep blue mist. It is said that we have ascended to day, more than  7000 feet, above the deep Barancas through whichwe have just passed; and still a peak arises to our right, around which we wound our tortuous way looking over walls, that looked straight down upon abyss's that were quite beneath us thousands of feet. I found enough here for days of sketching, over which we passed rapidly as it was a region said to be well filled with Robbers, and frequent to many scenes of bloodshed, robbery, and other vile deeds; a few desperate men in these wild mountain passes could doo much harm even to a  large party. On the summit there is a rude breastwork evidently thrown up for that purpose. Cliffs of huge brown rocks here hang over frightful debths and thousands of deep ravines cut deep into and down the rugged mountain. This is our highest elevation  in crossing Mexico, we have gradually ascended 7000 feet to the Barancas, and about 7000 feet again to the summet of this grand dividing ridge of Mexico, making in all an elevation of about 14000 feet above the levil of the Sea. Upon this height we now have the afternoon winds from the Pacific Ocean; and from this forward to the Pacific each day, blowing uniformly from the west, and sometimes very strongly.We now commence our gradual descent toward the Pacific Ocean, an event of some interest to us of course; leaving the scenes east of the great Cordilleres, for those descending gradually into the mild and fertile vallies on the  great western side of this distinguished mountain. No 73. is a sketch of the first scene descending into  a beautiful and fertile valley, along which are plenty of Ranchos, several small villages, several sugar  mills, fine farms, meadows, groves, and plenty of small Mexican dwellings, shaded by Bannanas, Plantains, or perhaps the Allamo, or at times the spreading oak. A pleasant stream of water meandered along this  valley, the margin of which was thickly interwoven with brushwood, wildflowers, and followed by pleasant green meadows, which contrasted in a striking manner with the shadeless, and wild barren mountains; that were broken and rudely tossed into the high air as the fierce storms would toss the waters of the mighty ocean; and as rudely wild, and void of vegetation or timber in many places. This day we have made a march of 54 miles, and arrived at our Mason in the town of [Eastlan ?] a hour after sun set. It appeared to be a fine largetown; at sun set I sketched Eastlan at a distance of a few miles to the  east, being in advance of a part of our train, which during this day got much scattered on the way. There was a fine large Church in this town, with a large shaded plaza or public square, upon which there was a grand display of many  kinds of fruits, drinks &c. including watermellons, Oranges, Bannanas, &c. &c. with Lemonade; Polka, etc. A grand procession of the virgin Mary took place, this evening parading in large crowds the various streets of the town with hundreds of Ladies and Gentlemen each in procession, carrying their separate candles. The immage of the Virgin, was of full size, richly dressed in dark silks, and carried in a handsome Sedan; Other processions took place during  the evening; but I did not see all of them. This is a beautiful town of several thousand inhabitants; the houses are improving, are much neater, larger, and the people becoming much more refined and civilized than many of those before passed; Western Mexico, is well known to be the most refined and civilized portion of that country. We were much pleased with the decided improvement of whitewashing and other displays of taste in this place.No 74. is a hasty sketch of Eastlan and its surrounding mountains. The valley in which it is situated, descends gradually westward towards the Pacific Ocean; and is under good cultivation with pleasant Ranchos', several small villages &c. [*April 7th*] Day warm and clear; with an afternoon breeze from the  Pacific. Commenced our march at sun rise; and proceeded along the meanderings of a pleasant creek; that traversed this interesting valley. A few miles west of Eastlan we passed through a town of considerable size, within which there was a handsome shaded plaza, with a large, curious, and antiquated church. This town was also much shaded by Bannana and Orange groves and a greater part of the houses were very genteel. Here some of our company obtained excellent cups of chocolate &c. Many kinds of fruit were likewise abundant in this place. By the way, as we have before frequently seen, were erected several small shrines of some 8 or 10 feet square, in each of which was suspended the  cross, and around which were wreaths of roses, natural and artificial, with candles partly burned, and other things belonging to their religious ceremonies. These with lone cross's are to be seen plentifully throughoutMexico, and either mark a place of worship, or the spot where some individual has [been] met with an untimely  end. Proceeding down this pleasant valley and winding around various spurs of the wild mountains, that  rear'd their rugged heads upon either side of us, we at 15 miles from Eastlan opened upon a view as in No. 75, with the appearance of a volcano to the right hand. The creek that before travelled rapidly a rocky bed, now joined with other water courses in passing through a ravine or narrow channel of great debth. We now passed over immense fields of wildest volcanic rocks that at some period had been partly fused, and thrown up in rugged masses exceeding any description; extending thus for many miles west and North. The appearance of the rocks was quite black; in places quite spongy, and resembling somewhat the heavy spray of a wild Ocean storm, thrown up in massive peaks, and pinacles, that were at  once suddenly petrified or cooled into black rocky masses of half fused granite &c. Such a field of forrest peaks and black [Schorae ?], I have never before witnessed. The government of Mexico, have cut and paved a road through this lava country at great expense, labor and time.The particulars of which they have taken care to place  upon a pedestial by the way side; whereas by passing the road (such as it was) around a few miles to the left  they might have avoided the worst peaks and ridges  of the [Schorae ?]. Some scrubb oaks high pentangular cactus,  Etc shaded the Lava road in places, until we came out upon  barren hills. No 76 shows a hasty sketch of a part of the  lava fields on our way, looking back Southeast. About  this valley, which have spread out to many miles,  many little Ranchos and villages were to be seen upon  the fertile spots, like favored places upon the  desert of Arabia. The mountains around were exceedingly  wild, and only a few of them even sparsely timbered by a  dwarfish growth, of scrubb oaks, pines, and wild cactus. This broad triangular cove or great valley, was traversed  in every direction by hills, between which were small and  fertile coves, passes, and ravines, along which only the villages  and Ranchos were located. During this afternoon we passed through several pretty villages, that were snugly hid  away in these little vallies, and after passing over   a number of rolling hills, we ascended a mountain  to the north, where we encamped at Rancho Ocott.a few hundred yards from this rancho I sketched scene No 77. looking back Southward upon that great valley of vallies, over which we had just passed; from a height of about two thousand feet. I then passed on up the road 2 miles with a friend, and from a height looking into a vast ravine of perhaps 8 or 10 hundred feet, I sketched scene No 78. looking South west. Showing two great mountains rising in a part of the valley before named; a large stream of water was leaping and bounding off from cliff to cliff down this immense ravine, the sound of which could be heard a considerable distance; whilst it was closely shaded by tall timbers, that rose up the steep sides of the abyss, near to its summet edge. During this day we have seen back in the valley several fine falls of water from 5 to 60 or 70 feet, very suitable for mills but not improved. Along this deep ravine there are fine locations for such purposes. From this place Northward the timber for many miles became very large and plentiful; with large Oaks and pines in particular. During this afternoon Mr Slaight and Mr Jones two of our company were misled upon the wrong track, which caused some fears as to their safety, but both came into camp just  before dark.It is highly important that companies should keep compact whilst crossing the Mountains of Mexico, as those who stray off, are liable to be cut off by those who constantly watch such opportunities in the  trail of the large parties who may cross their country  April 8th  Day warm and clear. During this night individuals well known, left our camp by night, and proceeded forward at full speed, 16 leagues to Tepec, in advance of our train, in order to Secure passage up to california for themselves exclusive of our company should there not be room for all. This was showing their nature horns and all, for which they afterwards doubtless sorely repented, as certain of them had before promised to remain by each other through to California. The remainder of our company proceeded as usual not at all pleased with the rush for passage, almost every Mexican  returning; when asked, gave us different reports about the chances of passenger from San Blass up to San Francisco; and we could ascertain nothing very definite and but little that was encouraging. Some telling us that there was but one vessel in port which could take but four or five more passengers and prices very high, with poor accommodations; others,that there were several vessels in port, and others that there were none that could carry more passengers, and thus the reports varied, but the remainder of us thought best to take things coolly and as they might come; which afterwards proved to be to our especial advantage at Mazatlan. Proceeding northward on the Summet of the mountain on  which we had just encamped, we passed through much large and valuable oak timber. During the morning, I  sketched No 79. which includes Norelio Mountain, as seen  at the distance of about 10 miles to the northward, being also within full view of the town of Tepec to which we were bound. About an hour after sketching the former, we commenced descending a graded road down the mountain,  a part of which I sketched as in No 80. after which we  crossed a fine creek, then passed over and around a number of wild hills with but few scattering habitations, and those of the poorest kind until we came out upon the open woodless hills, that were beautifully rounded and moulded as by art, and only covered by parched prairie grass, and  ranging thus at random around the base of the great Novelio Mountain, whilst sloping off gently in an extensive valley, which was walled in on the North, East, and South by formidable mountains.Again, we ascended a small ridge, which soon gave us a fine view of the great valley of Tepec. We continued descending for Some time upon rolling hills, very sparcely timber with here and there patches of Scrubb oaks, cactus, etc. within about 6 miles of Tepec. I took sketch No. 81. [showing] showing the appearance of the country around that beautiful town. And before entering the town within about a mile and a half I took sketch No 82. showing a fine Stonebridge plastered, and of neat construction; on the principal road to Tepec. This road is generally broad, though not agreeable for [?] vehicles of any kind and is likewise well supplied with fine dust, which during (this) the dry season is almost intolerable during a windy afternoon. Our company arrived in Tepec at 3.O. clock. P.M. a band of dusty travellers, with long beards, jaded, and all the usual et ceteras that attend such a long journey and more especially in Mexico, but not yet closing our journey through this peculiar country. On arriving we ascertained that those preceding us to Tepec had engaged passage up to San Francisco upon a schooner of about 30 tons, that was said to be unfit for service. They paying 70 dollars, and find themselvesbesides being compelled to sleep upon deck; and even at that thinking themselves lucky in getting the chance, at the same time chuckling at us, whoom they considered unfortunate; in not having a chance to sail from San Blass, and at the same time telling us that they pittied us, as we must evidently remain somewheres in Mexico possibly for months to come. But believing that from the greater importance of Mazatlan as a sea port, and place of business, we concluded after resting a day in Tepec to proceed thither, although it was yet another week's journey, the result of which will be seen greatly to our advantage. April 9th  Day warm and clear. In company with a friend (Mr. Sayre), I proceeded this morning at an early hour, several miles out of town upon the summet of a neighboring mountain; (it being a day rest for our animals &c) from the heights of which, an extensive and most beautiful view opened in every direction To the east we saw the lofty peaks of Novelio mountain, and very many of those pretty woodless, and grass covered egg shaped hills before mentioned. Far beyond which formidable mountains reared their misty shadows in dim outline high upon the horizon, upon which the morning's sun had already arissen in his glory amid flitting clouds. The South, thesome great chain of mountains ranged with their many lofty peaks; South west a beautiful valley continued for miles,  with a high mountain ranging west of it. The same mountain  approaching to within a mile of our peak, fell off abruptly  and a valley turned around at right angles with the  former, ranging off into red hills, towards the Pacific Ocean. An extensive and magnificent view broke upon us from  the North, which I endeavored to sketch as in No. 83. North East were seen mountains and peaks piled upon  mountains, many of which were seen far above the mists  and detached clouds of the morning. Here the country  descends rapidly upon the Pacific plains, which are  nearly two days journey from Tepec. The plains could  be seen far on the dim horizon but not the Ocean. This scene was extensive and grand beyond description. To the north and several hundred feet below us, there was  a circular lake of water, No. 84. partly covered with  green rushes, and edged by high walls of rocks, being rugged  bluffs of dark brown rocks, in places covered with a red soil. This lake was nearly round, and elevated several  hundred feet above the valley of Tepec, and exhibited  all the signs of having been at some period a vastcrater to this volcanic country, but now filled up  with water. We then descended into a deep ravine, at the  foot of the hill (letter A) No 84. Through which a fine large stream  water descended rapidly upon a rocky bed. Near the foot  of hill A. is located an extensive cotton factory belonging to Mess  Forbes & Co. as in sketch No 85 .and sketch No 86. taking  two different views of this handsome establishment. The proprietors I believe are Englishmen. Their garden  of Bannanas, Plantains, Oranges and other tropical fruits, is extensive, and exceedingly beautiful, and  more to the idea of some Hindoo scene than one in Mexico. The whole scenery about this factory is  pretty, tasty and romantic. This establishment does  an extensive business. We returned to town by 2.O. clock P.M. after which I sketched the interior of our  Mason (No 87.) or public house, which was tastefull constructed;  our quarters however were not as agreeable as the  appearance of the place. The church on the plaza was large  but of an ordinary appearance, and another similar one  in the town, but a very handsome one of smaller dimensions  1 1/2 miles from the plaza, which time would not  permit me to sketch, and attend to other duties.A hasty sketch of the plaza was also taken as in No 88. It was surrounded by large shade trees of the oak; and in the centre of it there was a pretty fountain of a plain but neat appearance. The plaza was almost entirely surrounded by colonade rows of usually two Story Stores of the first class. The streets of the town ran uniformly at right angles; were clean, and well paved; the same at Gaudalaxhara, the towns of Logos, and San Louis Potosi, etc. The rooves of the houses were uniformly flat, generally one story in height, frequently whitewashed, or neatly ornamented with various colors. But the suburbs of the town, as usual for Mexico, was surrounded by small mud cabins which so much destroys the good effects of Scenery about the Mexican towns, villages, Rancho's etc. At Tepec, we met another American party, and here also 10 of our company left us in order to proceed a distance of 60 miles to San Blass, and from thence embark upon a vessel they had never seen, which afterwards proved to be unseaworthy and landed them some 9 or 10 days afterwards at Mazatlan in (distress and other) difficultiesWe had remonstrated with them however at Tepec, and there they considered their chances much superior to ours. [*April 10th*]  Day warm and clear. Left Tepec at an early hour, and proceeded through a northwest pass, among red hills, little coves, and small narrow and fertile vallies among Shady groves, palms, Bannanas, Plantains, Oranges, &c. and when plenty of watermellons could be  obtained very cheap with other fruits, this region of the country appeared well setled with neat and Shady Ranches, and well supplied with running streams of water. Many farms here appeared like little paradis's for shade romance, and the comforts of life; and many were the  varied scenes of this [day] morning that were really captivating. [except] But in the after part of the day upon the planes, having descended upon a warmer country, we were  open more to the sun, and much annoyed by dust. In making our grand descent upon the plains, we passed down over a long rotine of rugged hills, that gradually diminished as we descended, being sparcely covered with large Palm trees, some underbrush, and now and then parched, prarie grass not of much interest. The view however on descending was extensive, as in sketch No 89.Having descended upon the Pacific Plains, we were  again in a much warmer climate. We again passed from the dull monotony of timbers upon the mountains when such may be found, to a lower country where a large variety were daily presented to our notice. We now saw Palms in great abundance, large oaks, the Banyan, Beach, some cedar, large cotton bearing trees, tropical fruit trees plentifully, with many whose species were unknown to us. We passed several small villages on the planes, and a number of Ranchos. Enormous trees of a species with which I am not familiar, but resembling the mulberry somewhat in shape  and leaf, and in other respects the Beach tree, grows by the road side in many places, and being dense for spreading and of very great magnitude, it frequently gave us an acceptable shade; during our travels across the planes. These five large shade trees, are however not too abundant, and by seeing them in the distance I frequently judged our distance from a Rancho; as they are favorite trees on these planes. This afternoon we crossed two almost dry beds of wheat when flush were called rivers, but not of great magnitudeOn this days route fruits, Mellons, etc, were plentiful and cheap. 16 Bannanas for 6 1/4 cts or a Madeau, A fair water mellon for a Madeau (6 1/4 cts) 1 madeau for a dish of beans stew'd with some meat. 1 madeau for 3 boiled eggs, and 1 madeau for 4 or 6 tortelias or corn cakes; As we had found it on the other side of the Cordilleres, we also experienced here; high prices in Scarce and barren places, and cheap things where the soil was good, well settled, and fruit groves, etc, consequently to be found. About 3 O. clock P.M. our train halted for the night at a Rancho 33 miles N west of Tepec which I sketched as in No 90. The water of a neighboring creek being warm, a part of our company were in to bathe. During this night Mr Davis (who joined us some days back) was scalded by the accidental overturning of our large camp kettle, in which was stewing a fine mess of chicken, supposed to have been done by wolves, that were heard about just before I was on duty as one of the Sentinels from 12 to 2 and several times, heard the wolves, Mr D was not badly scalded however. [*April 11th*]  Day clear and hot. Commenced our march at an early hour, and soon forded a broad and very rocky creek, and during the morning passed through several acceptable woodland groves.Passed a number of ranchos where fruits &c. were plenty and cheap; and the country now generally quite levil. About noon, we came upon the broad sandy beach of a river. Our saddles, baggage, &c. was conveyed across in small boats, (canoes) whilst the whole drove of our animals swam the river together. The scene was  interesting and having a few moments (after just finishing a fine large water mellon) I sat down and  sketched the river, Mountains, &c., as in View No 91. The mountains were still in view; and follow upon our right, all the way to Mazatlan, as we are now persuing our way up the coast, though not yet in Sight of the Pacific Ocean. This river which we have just now crossed (I was told) is called the \"Rio San Diago\", being about 18 Mexican leagues from Tepec, or something over 50 miles. Having crossed the River, whilst the mules was reloading &c. for our further progress, most of our company went into a town nearby (of some size) and refreshed themselves upon fruits, coffee, chocolate, eggs, &c. etc. The town though of good size, was dilapidated and of an ordinary appearance, though commanding apretty location. Persuing our course over a very dusty road that wound hither and thither upon a levil country of brushwood and larger clusters of timber, we passed through a village of perhaps 40 or more houses, all entirely deserted, except one, which was tennanted by one Solitary man of a fierce countenance, being a cripple, who had only a few poor mellons for sale at high rates. This was rather strange yet strangely true, one man the Sole lord of a desolate village, no other Mexican was seen in the whole place, and all was closed up without Signs of furniture; the place may have fell into the hands of Robbers, or be unhealthy; we did not ask respecting it of the man, although it excited remarks in our company. This afternoon afforded but little of interest except some large cotton fields, with ripe cotton, belonging to some Ranchos, and surrounded by fences, which is an uncommon thing in this country, fences are very  rare throughout all Mexico. we travelled many hundred miles without even seeing a fence; although there may be many farms, it is not every man that has a fence, and even those who posess them mostly have very short appologies for fences, which  are rare things in Mexico,I mean fences of wood stone fences of great length, have been seen almost every day or two, amongst the settled parts of the mountains. To day we saw, as beforementioned, fine fields of cotton; but for the first time that I remember in Mexico. We also saw a wild tree about the size and shape of an ordinary apple tree, bearing large and numerous pods of the fine white cotton; And a number of curious fruit trees about the woodlands and water courses. Much of this days travels, all things considered is not by any means inviting to travellers; being dusty in places open to the hot sun, and much of the time rather uncivilized in appearance, which however is no criterion to judge western Mexico by. Before sunset we halted, after a long days march at the Rancho of \"Buena Vista\" being about 145 miles from Mazatlan. I sketched this place as in No 92. A friend Mr Custer, and I went out afar the creak near by for game, and we returned in about 15 minutes with 3 large Pheasants upon which we made a fine supper, and obtained plenty more for our breakfast, and to carry with us for our dinner, our company numbering at this time between 25 and 30. Since leaving Tepec, those for San Blass taking  another road.[*April Thorsd 12th*] Left our Rancho at an early hour. Day clear and hot; with the usual afternoon winds from the Pacific. Passed over an extensive palm country this day, gentle slopes all day covered sparcely with tall and scattered Palm trees, grass burnt off for miles in places; much wild game by the way, few habitations, and those generally of the lowest class. In the morning sketched No 93. of the lofty peaks &c. of the  Cordilleres on our night, which are always in full view in passing up the coast . About noon we again came  to the bank of another River which was partly dry, and at this season fordable, I did not ask its name, but the town of Cauponetta , was on the opposite side to which we forded. A number of Mexican women were along the margin of this river at their customary employment of  washing out clothing; one very clear trait of the Mexicans. Sketch No 94. shows, the river, town, and mountain scenery from opposite Cauponette Puebla. After refreshing  ourselves upon mellons, fruit, etc, in this pleasant town we proceeded forward at a rapid gait to finish a long days march. Much of our road was very dusty, though there was less wind than usual; our country slightly rolling and upon the night a full view of the lofty mountains of the coast.This night we encamped at a desolate Rancho a few miles beyond a river, where things had a distressing appearance we could neither obtain water or food of any importance at this place, so that most of us had neither supper nor breakfast. The appearance of everything about these few huts, was perfectly squallid, and the natives almost totally unclothed and appearing reckless and unconcerned about any thing. We camped beside the road, and huts, and kept strict watch during the night; but a few miles back, on the other side of the river we could have encamped at a small village, where all the conveniences were at hand, but being only a few days from Mazatlan, our company became very anxious to finish their land travels in Mexico, and consequently pressed each day. We missed it, decidedly in crossing the river this night, as we left a pleasant camp grove and conveniences at that place, for a desolate place where we lost two meals, and had no water either for our animals or ourselves  April 13th  Day warm and clear with a fine seabreeze this afternoon Passed through a nearly level country, covered with scattering palms; we came to a village of a squallid appearance about 10. O.clock A.M. where by much trouble we made out to get something to  eat.of all squallid places we had yet seen, this village was the climax. Here in front of a cabin, sat a wretched looking woman clothed in rags, and her feet projecting on the walk from a heavy pair of wooden stocks, where she was fastened probably for some offence. The whole of the inhabitants were almost entirely unclothed and appeared to be living in misery and starvation. Having the bold mountains on our right which were all day in full view, we proceeded onward up the coast through Palm forrests, that seem'd never ending, and towards noon oppressively hot; several crosses were passed this day; whilst this section of the country appeared very much uncivilized; and we frequently met men, entirely without clothing. A range of mountains seem'd now to range off west to the Pacific Ocean, over which it appeared that we must pass, on the morrow; approaching within a few miles of their wild and rugged base, we encamped at a Rancho called Cerauso, as in Sketch No 95. here things appeared more genteel than on the previous night and we were enabled to purchase a scanty allowance of provisions, which were in demand and highly acceptable.April 14th Day clear and hot, Left our rancho at an early hour, and proceeded along the base of rugged mountains directly west to within some 5 or 6 miles of the Pacific beach, but not in sight of the ocean, as we came upon a low ground, we passed around the end of those mountains, and travelled over flat planes covered with high grass, and in places pools of Salt water, and yet on this day we did not see the ocean, although at one time we were said to be quite near to the beach. from the edge of a Small Salt lake, I sketched some large and high rocks, which were the terminus of the mountains and nearest to the ocean as in No. 96. I had no time to ascend it, or I may have possibly first beheld the Pacific from its Summet. Again we appeared to direct our course inward from the coast, which brought us in the afternoon to a broad river, with wide beaches of sand and gravel. This stream we forded and entered the pleasant town of Rosario as in sketch No. 97. The location of this town with its mountain scenery was very pretty and interesting. Fruits of every kind with fine mellons were very abundant and cheap in this place. The churchwas large, antiquated, but of handsome finish; up the river about two miles and upon the opposite side, there appeared in full view a similar building of great magnitude, and from its colors and peculiar structure appearing to be much superior to the building in Rosario. Mountains of great magnitude were from 5 to 10 miles to the eastward. In the afternoon we left this pleasant and populous town, and persuing our way among gently rolling hills Palm groves, and vast tracts of brushy oaks, Bodock trees & we encamped at a village of a genteel but  odd appearance; where provisions were plenty, and cheap, and the inhabitants quite friendly. Oranges, mellons &c plentiful. April. 15th  Day clear and hot, persued our course at an early hour, travelling the same routine of plains, rolling grounds, gullies, Palm forrests, &c this day we passed through many miles of Bodock trees, which much resembled an orchard of civilization, extending, far beyond the reach of the eye, with many thousands of bushels of large Bodock apples; I have no doubt but that in time, the seed of these trees will be sought after  for making hedge fences over countries where timber may be scarce. At noon we passed through a fine large townand stopped for a time to refresh ourselves at the market plazas; immense quantities of watermellons were seen in every direction; Soon a large congregation of Ladies, Gentlemen, and civilized looking people came pouring forth from a  large and antiquated church upon the plaza; and people quietly on their way to their houses, though viewing our company with some little surprise and attention. From this town we persued our way over \"slightly rolling\" country of Palms, oaks, and in places a variety of timbers and encamped at night as usual at a rancho. April. 16th Day clear and hot. Persued our journey at an early hour being in full view of Mountains all day, sometimes among hills, and at others upon plains of Palms or extensive groupes of underbrush, with scattering trees of magnitude. The mountain Scene No 98. was sketched this afternoon, from the summet of a Small hill. during the day we passed over several open praries and at night encamped at a rancho of a respectabe appearance beside a fine stream of good water. April 17th Day clear and hot. Persued our journey at Sunrise in order to reach Mazatlan this day. During themorning our road wound considerably amongst small hills, and was sparcely timbered with some Palms, Oaks, &c during the whole day, except where Salt lakes had left level planes of Sand, with not even vegetation Sometimes for miles in some directions upon one of these sand beds, I witnessed to day, what is called mirage, or the deception of water, ahead. For some time I supposed that we were coming to the margin of a lake whose waters were troubled into waves by wind, but on approaching the same, I discovered the mistake; by discovering that the heat of the Sun caused a mist to arise from the sand, which by its position and  reflection to the eye caused the deception called mirage. about noon we arrived in the old village of Mazatlan distant from the present Sea port of Mazatlan, about 24  miles. At present it is a place no importance, and is much dilapidated; we obtained some fruit here and proceeded on our journey to the port of Mazatlan, before leaving this place I sketched the ruins of an ancient church at one corner of the old village Square as in Sketch No 99. Shortly after leaving this place we forded a river, and persued our course over a level ground towards the Pacific OceanSketch No 100. was taken 15 miles from the Port of Mazatlan. Those hills on its back ground are along the Pacific, and several of them stand out in the Ocean. The foreground is a Sandy plain, on which at w, I thought I saw the lake of water, which as I was very thirsty at the time, appeared quite acceptable, and after taking the sketch, I dashed away full speed with my horse, to reach it with the company, but it proved to be a very complete deception of water. Approaching within 8 miles of the Pacific, we came to the bank of a Salt lake, which I sketched as in No 101. showing the distant hills near the port of Mazatlan. At 6 miles I took another sketch as in No 102. whilst we were passing around the Salt lake. The fresh breeze was fanning us from the pacific; the declining Sun was shedding his gentler evening rays upon us from over the hills of the Port of Mazatlan, as we wound our way around that pretty lake before named, and crossing the flats, we arising suddenly upon a high ground came at once in full view of the long sought for port of Mazatlan, and for the first time a broad and beautiful view of the Pacific Ocean, its islands, shipping, and its foaming  surfs that chased each other rapidly upon the pretty beach before us. What a captivating view; two great objects at one view, the Pacific, and the port of Mazatlan  with also the gratification of now closing our land,  journey across Mexico, and again embarking upon the  mighty waters of the Ocean; and thus ending the second great chapter after leaving Philadelphia, and about to  enter now upon a third important change. All  the past toils were passed over without a murmur, when arriving here, none would of course return by the same way should such ever offer, but none were sorry that they had encountered the toils and fatigues of this journey when they knew it had now closed by land, and was about to commence by Sea; and all were of course well pleased and quite merry on entering the town with their prospects of soon being at Sea; and done with Mexico."

    "paragraph": "Having been some time impressed with the belief that a trip to California would be beneficial not only in a pecuniary point of view, but likewise to the better regulation of health and future happenings, I resolved about the 1st of January of 1849 to have my profession that of a Mathematical Instrument Maker and the eve to be remembered Monumental city of Baltimore for a trip to the golden shores of the far western El Dorado. Circumstances favoring, I made preparations in Philadelphia presuming that my trip thither would be made by sea around Cape Horn a distance of 7000 miles in the Ship \"Mason\" which advertised to leave that port several times fixing definite days of departure. Mr W.H. Ogden called upon me requesting my naming in forming a company then to be limited to 10 or 15 select gentlemen. I consented and gave my name as one of the party them numbering three, whose names were W. H. Ogden, B Jay Antrim and W Middleton, the latter of whom had since resigned and remained at his residence in New Jersey. Mr Ogden and myself drew up a notice at Mr Bonsals' Book Store, at No 33 1/2 Market Street, Philadelphia and inserted the same in the \"Ledger,\" and \"North American.\" The advertisment requesting all desirous of making a speedy and an agreeable journey via Matamoras, Monterey, Saltileo, Durango and Mazatlan to California to address \"Camargo,\" at the office's of those two respective papers, which was soon followed by a number of applicants; who were severally visited by Mr Ogden and myself. Mr Jones, of 6th Street, being the first of that number added to our list. We soon procured a room for meeting at No 100 Chestnut Street through the kindness Majors Collins and Ross, where we met in harmony and concert of action until we had completed our company and extended the number of the same to Forty. At one of the Meetings, the name of \"Camargo Company\" was adopted, which is the name of a Mexican town, to which we were first destined from Philadelphia, by sea, and from thence after having procured there our outfit of mules provissions & to proceed overland to Mazatlan via the abovementioned route. Old resolutions adopted in our \"Camargo\" meetings limiting our numbers were several times rescinded and new ones were adopted until our number had increased to forty as before mentioned & Committees of Camp Equipage, provissions, pasports, protections, for chartering a vessel &c all of whoom acted and reported accordingly. Having ascertained that the abovenamed route was infested with hoards of warlike and savage Camanchee Indians, who were committing outrages and massacring those found in their way, and that the same route was in consequence very dangerous, and believing it rash, as also influenced by friends, I withdrew my name from that route, and proposed the Tampico route to the company as the safest, most pleasant, and a shorter land distance than the former; which then being unfavorably received, I withdrew by advice, and my own impressions of that course, and then prepared to proceed around by Cape Horn. In the mien time, the company adopted the Tampico route via San Louis Potosi &c. and —Mr. Ogden called upon me to inform me of it and his desire with many of my old friends was that I should return to the company: and as they had changed the rout to the one I thought most prefferable, I again added my name. Mr Ogden was elected President and myself Secretary of the \"Camargo Company,\" and in my leaving Mr W Robinson, merchant, was elected to supply my place, in which by request and his absence I served several times after my return. A committee appointed chartered the Brig \"Thomas Walters,\" to convey our company of forty to Tampico in Mexico, which was contracted for at $50.00 each, for cabin passage, and the vessel advertised to sail at 8 O Clock A.M. on the 31st of January 1849. Four members declined going with us and three others filled their vacancies. In consequence of some difficulty in entering our articles at the custom house for Mexico, whereby our Captain and vessel was in danger of the laws of Mexico, - our departure was delayed until 9.0.clock A.M. on the following morning the 1st of February. Feb 1st Slight Snow, cold and finally sleety rain; I repaired with all remains of baggage to the vessel at an early hour, and found many congregated to witness our departure. The crowds along the wharves notwithstanding the inclemency of the weather, continued to increase until many hundreds lined the surrounding piers. A few minutes before 9.0.clock our company repaired with arms to two lines upon the Quarter Deck, and fired from guns and pistols a departing salute. Mr Robinson then presented - \"three cheers to our Country\", which our company responded to with warmth - \"three cheers to the friends and dear bonnie lassies, we leave behind,\" and it burst simultaneously from the very hearts of all. - and \"three cheers to Philadelphia\" which we answered appropriately according with our sentiments of the Quaker City. The citizens upon the wharves responded - \"three cheers for the success of the Carmago Company\" followed by a succession of cheers for individuals named in our company, among which the clerk of the Ship \"Mason,\" observing my singular dress in common with my comrades and knowing me, gave \"three cheers for the Buckskin Injnn.\" and thus did our friends cheer us at the hour of separating from all that was dear to us, to embark upon the great and eventful Ocean of future prospects. About, 9.0.clock A.M. the steamboat \"Wave' came beside and before night towed us in co with another vessel as far as New Castle. At New Castle we dropped anchor for the night, and finding a mistake of six packages of provisions which were nescessary for the completion of the captains' manifest for Mexico, it was found requisite to send Mr Thompson, immediately back to Philadelphia in order to bring on the same by express, which he did by an early hour on the following morning, and received a vote of thanks from the company. This evening was spent with considerable spirit and mirth on the part of Messrs Robinson, C. Jones and Bates; which however was excused by the company in general as they were known to be gentleman, and believed to be unaccustomed to such heavy exercises. Besides the leaving of home under the deepest immaginable of melancholly feelings. This day a vote was taken in the affirmative for prohibiting the smoking of cigars in either cabin of the Brig, the quantity of powder and combustibles on board beeing deem'd a sufficient reason. The Roll was called and the following gentlemen answered to their names, --  to wit. Some of our company went on shore at New Castle and made some few purchases of small articles. Have up anchor at an early hour, and got under way towards the breakwater. weather cold and hazy. Proceeded but a short distance this day and cast anchor 2 miles below Reedy Island, in the afternoon where we remained until 4.0.clock the next morning. Weather clear and cold with a North West wind which drove us out the bay in a beautiful and interesting manner with full canvass on a bounding sea. Personal feelings were consulted over the guard in a member of cases, and after, relief expressed. My feelings were much agitated in consequence of the heavy ocean [swells], and I left an elegant dinner of soup and chickens to contemplate the foamingbillows, and returned when convenient to finish the same, which I did in a few minutes with more relish after having cast over a full account much to the relief of my inexpressible feelings. The dinner table was left patronized by our gents than on the day previous, who were also contemplating the foaming billows with the same inexpressible feelings. One instance of inebriation occurred this day which created unpleasant feelings between the captain and said individual, but was amicably settled to the benefit of said person and any of the company, should they in future indulge, which it is presumed they will not doo, as many if not nearly the whole of them, appear to be temperate and sensible men. This evening being much moderated, with a clear and beautiful Moon, most of our party promenade the whole round of the vessel in rapid Military order, whilst the brig bounded upon the long and high Ocean Swells with that majesty becomming the bread bosom of the Atlantic; whilst the spray threw up to the bowsprit and the sheeted sides, it's showery foam, gilded by the silvery rags of the Moon, and followed in the wake  by a long bright trail of foaming ripples receding in our pathway back to the horizon.Our boat dashed on handsomely to the tune of a brisk wind, whilst the music and merry songs of the happier ones arose in concert with the gently whistling winds that playfully tuned their ocean song amid our rigging and canvass. The whole scene was exceedingly  interesting, and the music harmonious,  being sung by good voices, well timed, and filled with the deepest base voice, for a human being that I ever heard, which added greatly to the sweetness of the music; they sang numerous songs that had more richness amid a scene like this, than I had ever before supposed could be the case; I enjoyed it very much. Harmony and quietness prevail generally throughout the cabins, and no discords have occurred this day. A clear, mild, and beautiful morning. I rose early in order to behold the Sun rise over the ocean, which was beautifully decorated  with long light clouds, which partly shaded its disk and gave more glowing colors to the scene; At 10. A.M. a meeting for worship,was called on the after dark, and Revd Mr. Woods,  officiated, assisted by the Revd Mr Blake, nearly each  member attend the meeting; which was conducted  with very creditible solemnity and attention. The  subject was to those who go down upon the great  deep, with a copy of an address delivered by a Revd  gentleman to the young gentleman of Boston, on emigrating  to California, and the choice of good society. A pistol exploded from firing last night, and Mr. Robinson  was cut back of the right shoulder by a piece  at least 5 inches in length, the would though sore  to stay is not however dangerous. This afternoon  many guns and pistols were fired at the little  dog sharks, that are now following our vessel in  numbers; 7 or 8 of which were caught and hauled  on board with fish hooks and lines; they were  usually two feet in length, and bore some resemblance  to the common pike. This afternoon we have  made but little progress, owing to a calm, and  have hardly average 2 knots an hour for half the day,  Towards night clouds arose with sprinkling rain  and there was a general disposition to be in doors. Monday 5th - Up before sunrise and saw the sparkling ocean spray as our galliant boat drove swiftly o'er mountain waves before a fierce gale which changed to a storm by noon, a day long to be remembered by many of our sea sick company. Such a sight all over the Brig, it only kneeds  an old sea faring man to judge of over 30 green ones just ushered to sea in a fierce gale with rain pelting them like so much fine shot; and they bounding sky high on mountain billows. The bounding of our vessel was truly majestic and far beyond what I had ever before witnessed; all sails were tied up and nothing but the small stay sail open to the gale during the afternoon Nearly the whole company were sick, including myself, but I did not so much as loose one meal by it. I soon had an apetite, which was also  the case with many others; few however were at dinner this day. Upon the whole it was a day of miserable sickening, storm, gales and long billows many of which were full 25 feet in perpendicular height.clouds, rain, howling winds and high sea raged all day Tues 6th Beautiful clear morning, after a terrible night of high winds and high billows. To day the ocean moved in immense swells like small hills, with yawning vallies between, but the morning was clear, and the air mild and further fire unescessary. Our stove being upset this morning we did not rectify it, nor feel the need of it. The sick ones are improving and getting lively; the vessel has bounded on beautifully all day, and we crossed the Gulf Stream this morning, winds from the west which drove us out to sea, possibly 350 miles from land, and this evening a little south of the lattitude of Charleston of South Carolina. Saw one sail to the west this morning. Light clouds in the afternoon, and pleasant moonlight evening, with the sea and winds pretty high. Company merry on deck, & Saw one porpose, 5 or 6 nautilus, and gulf weed this morning all interesting to one looking for a subject. It should have been mentioned that Mr. Hewes, one of our company, lost his belt overboard yesterday containing two hundred and twenty five dollars in gold.Wednesday 7th A cloudy morning, high winds and mountain billows; air cool and winds mostly from the west. We bounded on bravely all this day o'er the foaming sea, realing too and fro, with our deck at times almost at an angle of 45, both side ways and lengthwise. The dishes on the dinner table partook likewise of the general commotion. This whole day was another of swift winds, amounting almost to a gale, which stirred up the billious temperaments of our company as usual, and there were many sick ones about deck again as usual. At 12, at noon, we passed a sail in the distance and at 1.0.clock P.M. another to which we hoisted a red flag with red star upon a square white ground, which they answered with the American flag; the winds and the ocean being  to high to speak them. They were bound to the States. We passed them in about Latitude 32 and about 400 miles out to sea from South Carolina. At night the moon rose amid flying clouds, but the air was so cool, the wind so high, and our deck so much wet by the spray from theangry mountaneous ocean, that few remained on deck long; the berths being prefferable. It is not an uncommon thing to hear one or two fall out of their berths, upon the floor, and to observe a general scrambling of boots, hats, trunks, &c for a downhill race to the opposite sides of the cabin whilst cradling upon the high blue  ribs of the ocean. Then occasionally springing a breeze. Thursd 8th Light clouds, air mild, and a pleasant breeze from the North East, with light ocean waves. Held a meeting on financial arrangements on the Quarterdeck at 10.A.M. Saw a ship ahead this morning bound southward in Latitude 29° 40,\" about 400 miles out to sea. Fine sunny day with bland breezes and very light ocean swells. Nearly all of our company are amusing themselves about decks variously. Catching sea weeds, and fifty other little time killing amusements. At 4 O.clock P.M. we held a meeting on the Quarterdeck during which time we elected Mr. Grant, our Captain, for the trip over Mexico to Mazatlan. Mr. McCrellish, 1st Lieutenant, Mr. Hughes, 2nd do Mr. W. H. Ogden the Quarter Master, and Mr. Thompson, the Commissary. It being understood that we go through during our voyage, a regular Military drilling in order to fit us for cases of insurgency in our Mexican Campaign. A pleasant moonlight evening, air mild, with a brisk breeze, and sailing about 10 Knots the hour. Friday 9th A beautiful morning of pleasant breezes; up early and saw the sun rise clear upon the rolling ocean. We sailed beautifully all day with a fine breeze. Things passed off pleasantly and merrily all day, with a mild and elegant moonlight evening; set up until 11.O.clock, hearing and telling wonderful things, which were magic charms, when told by moonlight on so mild and exquisite evening as this, added the gentle undulations of the sea, the fountains of spray, and the bland Zephyrs of the South. Saw a number of white flying fish during this afternoon, which were beautiful and attractive. Sat 10th A clear, warm, and calm morning, sun even getting hot Near, but not in sight of the West Indies. No wind and almost quiet; Ocean almost quiet; This day proved to be a regular calm, and the sun very warm. Coats and vests off, and hardly a breeze. We do not appear to have moved 15 miles all day. A breeze sprung up in the evening and got us under headway at about 5 knots, with a pleasant late moonlight night. A flying fish came on board this evening and was captured. All are well so far on the vessel. Sund 11th Morning warm, clear, and a brisk wind driving us at the rate of 10 knots towards the island with the \"hole in the wall\", but not in sight yet (11 A.M.) Came in sight of the Bahamia island at 1/2 past 11. A.M. but there being a high head wind, we lost all this afternoon and night in tacking too and from the land, with a high sea. Held a meeting  for worship this afternoon at 1/2 past 3.O.clock. Rev'd Mr. Woods delivered a powerful and highly eloquent appeal to our company, with a good effect. A request was sent to our Chaplain (elect) by several individuals, to their discredit, not to hold services on board; but it being overruled by a large majority, services were held as usual. Monday 12th Mild with high head winds, only about 10 miles gained by tacking the whole day. We were insight of the islands several times during the day. At night a black and angry storm rolled over us with rain and fierce winds raising huge billows, howling and tossing us fearfully about on the ocean all night. Silent fear reign'd in our company, but some hardened cases went so far as to make sport in the midst of this exciting scene. Tuesday 13th Passed the \"hole in the wall,\" with light house early this morning. The sun rose beautifully in a fleecy cloud of golden hue, and a brisk wind drove us rapidly towards the Bahamia Bar, the day is clear, mild, and our Brig passed 5 other vessels this morning all bound in the same direction. Arrived at the Bahamia Bar, at 12 Meridian, and crossed it during the afternoon and evening; The water on the Bar is from 15 to 40 feet generally, and sufficiently clear in most places to see bottom at 15 feet. The bottom appears to be composed of white sand, with here and there patches of sponge. The color of the water on the Bar for about 60  miles is a beautiful light Skye Blue, whilst that of the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico is of a darkand blue color. we passed Berry islands this morning and saw there, a number of small sailing craft, and some about a wrecked vessel. A colored gentleman has a very fine farm, and several wives upon one of these singular looking islands. A good breeze drove us on rapidly ahead of all other vessels. The day has been warm clear, and the sun set among gilded clouds showing us a scene exciting universal admiration. Such a glowing sun set scene, few of us have ever before witnessed even in midsummer. There is something exquisite, glowing, brilliant and more diversified with brilliant and unapproachable colors accompanying a sun set scene in this southern chime, that seldom occurs to those farther north, and infinitely above the Artists pencil. [*Wednesday 14th *] Temperature mild, high and favorable wind driving us rapidly to the South west over the gulf of Mexico. No land in sight this morning. Saw several hundred flying fish this afternoon; the vessel appeared to scare them out of the water. We travelled very rapidly all this day and night.[*Thursd 15th*] Morning clear and mild, with a strong breeze driving us rapidly ahead, no land in sight. The gulf is here of a bluish brown appearance and occasionally when the sun is in a certain position of a greenish cast. Our vessel is now dashing off spray and waves of white foam as though she were ploughing by steam. One of our company Mr Chevallier, fell  down our cabin stairs this morning, but was not seriously injured, though stunned by the (long) fall. [*Frid 16th*] Morning clear, warm, and a regular calm. We were lying still at sun rise, but a breeze sprung up during the morning which increased to a strong wind during the afternoon, and drove us forward quite rapidly. This day was warm and clear. Saw many flying fish as usual with some Nautilus, & the Gulf waters appear now nearly black. The spray is flying skye high o'er deck, and we are dashing onward within about 550 miles of Tampico. Cool, high head wind, rough sea and day generally  cloudy, a day of but little interest. Cool, wind from the North, a strong gale with some rain, sea very high and disagreeable. Saw large schools of Porpoises, at several different times playing about the bow of the vessel, flying fish abundant, with occasionally some curious sea birds. This whole day & night has been exceedingly boisterous and unpleasant. Mon.d 19th  Morning clear, air mild, fair wind and travelling pretty fair. The sick ones of yesterday are getting lively again. no land yet in sight. pleasant evening and travelling rapidly ahead. Tues.d 20th  Morning clear, mild, with fair wind and rapid travelling within 200 miles of Tampico. Wed.nd 21st  Warm and clear. Gulf in a calm. discovered  land at 1/2 past 12 P.M. a fair breeze in the afternoon water of the Gulf getting quite green. The coast of Mexico ranges in barren and here and there partly cultivated hills. very Singular scenery. The pilots came out to us at 4 P.M. and took us into Tampico by dark, being up a small and crooked river about 6 1/2 miles. Vegetation &c was all green and the Spring verdure was here in all its richness fully displayed. The breakers running upon the shore were quite interesting and our entranceto Tampico over the bar was quite favorable. The  county about Tampico is in flats and broken hope  and there into low rolling hills of a peculiar  appearance, covered here and there with dense Chaparell. An officer boarded our vessel and examined  our passports, and we anchored off Tampico in the  river Rio Paneuco. Many porposes were playing  in the gulf as we entered the river. it was a beautiful sun set scene, and the weather quite warm.  we were not permitted to go on shore this evening. We have now arrived in Mexico, 20 1/2 days from  the wharf in Philadelphia. Clear. & Warm like August. landed this morning  at 10.A.M. in Tampico. went to the city Plaza and  examined strange costoms, dress, appearances of things &c. wandered with friends about town and suburbs all  day except when our baggage passed the Custom  House, when we had all taken to private rooms  rented for our company. Our impressions of Tampico  and the Mexicans in general, was at first quite unfavorable,  but in a few days becoming more familiarized with their  very singular manners and appearances, we felt more at home Tampico. State of Tamaulipas. Mexico. 23rd For one Real or 12 1/2 cts in company with a friend I crossed the  Rio or river Paneuco, to the shore of the State of Vera Cruz, from which place I sketched Tampico, as per plate No. 1. To a citizen of the States unaccustomed to foreign life, it at once presents an oriental appearance. There are two plaza's or public squares in the city the principal one facing the  river and the other back, upon which two of the Military posts and a small plain cathedral are located. The streets run generally at right angles, and three fourths of the  houses are one story in height, without chimnies, window glass, boards, or brick; being usually constructed either of bamboo, mud, or stone, which are generally plastered upon the exterior surface, and occasionally painted. The roof of each principal dwelling generally partaking of the usual Mexican trait, though more Americanized than  most other Mexican cities. The suburbs are almost entirely composed of cabins of Bamboo, thatched with the leaves of  the palmetto. The city is located upon a slightly undulating ground and almost entirely surrounded by water. The many singular plants with the beautiful flowers and foliage of spring combined with the lively colors of the dwellings, gave to Tampico, a singular and highly interesting appearance. The mainplaza, is paved with limestone (vide sketch No 2.) in the centre of which there is a large circular pediment of limestone rising in 6 steps, upon the summet of which there was once a monument of Santa Anna; which has been destroyed in their Revolutionary events. The building marked No 1. belongs to the British government; it is a costly and handsome establishment, and is  the head quarters for the immense quantities of silver, brought from the mines of San Louis Polosi. The markets are held every morning upon a part of this plaza. It is inferior to those in the States, though more abundantly stocked with the tropical fruits, at much less prices. Beef, fowls, fish, eggs, cheese, beans, peas, yams, tomatoes, &c with Lemons, Oranges, Bannanna's, plantains, sugar cane, coco nuts, with many vegitables supply this market at cheap rates. Almost every article kept by the Grocers, Dry good Merchants, hardware houses and other merchantile establishments of the States may be found here, but some of the are extravigantly dear. The custom house stands upon the main plaza facing a wooden pier upon the river. Coffee, sugar, rice, tea, tobacco and some other articles are virtually prohibited by their duties. Our party had about $20 worth of the essence of tea, the duties of which was over $30. No. 2 is the dwelling of Mr. Chase the American Counsil.The costom house officers are in general exceedingly punctilious and exact, but a small gold piece, has occasionally induced some of them as in other parts of the Republic, to put on  green spectacles. Our company of 40. were all presented to a tall thin and dignified praefect or chief Alcalde, who signed each pasport, for which he charged each $1. We occupied 3 large rooms in a retired part of the city,  near one of the principal barracks, and a part of the  time cooked our own provisions. We saw several military parades, as large forces were temporarily stationed here,  to prevent a rise on the part of the citizens of this city and State for independence, and annexation to Texas, or  in plain words Annexation to the United States. There was a patroll of small parties of Soldiers with  drum, fife, beaugles, &c. at almost every hour of the day. The complexion of the Mexicans is generally copper, bronze, and sometimes almost black. Their hair black and straight and their features partaking much of the Indian. I think  there is a marked difference between the features and the  color of the Spaniard and the Aztec Indian of Mexico, but they are called Mexicans. The real Aztec occupies generally the lower grades of life, but they appear tobe by far the most honest, sociable, polite, and hospitable. Though, as in other countries there are very conspicuous exceptions. The Sabbath is but little observed here, church open with most of the stores &c in the morning, and all closed in the  afternoon, for dances called fandango's, cockfights and other amusements, etc. You can get a good cup of coffee on the  plaza, or at the \"Caffe de Reverdy\" for a maydue or 6 1/4 cts. toast bread 6 1/4 cts. a cup of excellent chocolate one Real. 12 1/2 cts. eggs 12 1/2 cts per doz. about 2 1/2 lbs of coarse sugar for a  Quartee or 3 cent piece of silver. Flour is high, and bread dear. Tortelias are very common, when well made they are excellent, they are simply finely pulverized corn baked in large thin wafers, until they snap like thin sea biscuit. The Mexicans do not generally live as well nor in the  same manner as those of the States with some exceptions. I have however, tasted pastries here surpassing any thing of the  kind in the States. Good wine from 37 1/2 to 75. cts per bottle. Freoles, or black beans, plenty, cheap, and excellent. In  dress they are peculiar, with many varieties of fashion, and possibly as different from the Americans (in general) as may be found throughout the whole world. A tapering and broad rim hat called a Sombrero; often a tight  [*But meals are usually charged from 25 to 50. cts. and their appendages in proportion.*]and curiously figured buckskin jacket, over clean linen,  a pair of figured buckskin pants opening and buttoning up from top to heel, under the right and left arm, being small above and as broad as a Sailor below; they are generally unbuttoned as high as the knee or the pocket, exhibiting a pair of fine white linen pants beneath, which are also quite airy. The Mexicans are very clean in their dress, in this respect they far surpass the United States. Even our servants or mule drivers, were dressed in their  clean white linens; a thing most remarkable for this country considering their state of civilization. The Cargador or porter will carry a box or package, and yet appear not to soil his fine linen. The high tariffs of Mexico, prevent  the coarser articles from being imported, consequently the  Mexican markets abound with the finest foreign goods. The cloth, or linen is confiscated if it does not count so many threads to the inch when passing the custom house. Lands held in this country from old titles is good, but that from the government is not safe. Mr. Chase, our American  consul, says that during his stay of 15 years at Tampico, he has known the Mexican government to change 16 times consequently their laws, &c. are but temporary powers of vacilationIt is necessary to have a pasport to enter this country which will cost $2 in the States, to countersigned by the Alcalde of each large town you pass through within 48 hours after your arrival, costing at each place 25.cts. with also a pasport to leave the country; A passport to carry arms, and a passport to carry any amount of money beyond your expenses, at 25 per cent discount. Owing to the  reports respecting the country we had to pass over to San Louis Potosi, 5 of our number withdrew and proceeded by themselves. Mr Grant, then withdrew with a large portion of our company, leaving us but 19, which embodied a separate  mining company, having with them a large amount of mining tools, provisions, medicines, etc. amounting to considerable baggage which the other division thought would detain them some weeks longer in getting through to Mazatlan; consequently that party of 16 organized and proceeded some 5 days in advance of us, and procuring their horses at Mr. Laflers Rancho, or farm, they proceeded with dispatch to San Louis Potosi etc. Our party after selling off some unnecessary articles (as every pound to Mazatlan cost us 40 cts.) proceeded on the journey, having obtained our horses of Mr Lafler; 16 miles up the river of Paneuco. The other party of course expectedto be in San Louis Potosi, at least for 8 days ahead of our tardy mules and mustangs. They arrived in San Louis Potosi on the evening of the 21st of March, and our party at sun rise next morning to their surprise, as this journal from Tampico, will show. During our stay in Tampico, many of our party formed acquaintances in this city friendly to the Americans, a disposition evinced throughout the state of Tamaulipas. The weather here is quite as hot as august in the States,  but a fine sea breeze comes from the Gulf of Mexico, every afternoon; that makes our perambulations about town more pleasant. The Senioretta's or Ladies wear no bonnets, but invariably shawls upon their heads, I have seen some that were very beautiful; the early evening is their favorite time of appearance. This is decidedly a great country for moschitoes, ticks, and all kinds of loathesome vermin as we will herein after prove. The States bear not the slightest resemblance in species, quantities, and qualities to them, as they are positively the most numerous and most troublesome inhabitants of Mexico. To pick off 3 or 500 ticks from your pants and coat, as the cost of a venture in some places among the small weeds and bushes, might seem unreasonable, but such is very possible to occurSund 25th  The Priest, has extended an invitation to our company to  attend church. I visited and found but few present. The church is handsomely decorated inside but has a very  antiquated appearance without.  26th No rain and weather excessively warm, and moschetoes  innumerable, and insupportable. I repaired to the bluff  on the river, and from the highest part of it sketched  scene No 3, which comprehends an extensive and interesting  range of country. The first river to the right passing north  is the Rio Tamosee. West of it is the rio Paneuco,  a beautiful little stream meandering off towards San  Louis Potosi, and navigable 150 miles for light draught  boats, through no steamers have yet ascended it for. at fig. 1  is Laflers' Rancho 16 miles up the river; west of it for about  20 miles there is a level prairie. The Mountains fig. 2.  are interesting, as they abound with numerous ancient  walls, curiosities, and remains very similar to those discovered  in Yucatan, by Stephens. An ancient city is  supposed to have covered a number of square miles  on the summet of this mountain; which has been described by Norman of New Orleans. Beyond this west by south  two peaks of immense and distant mountains may be seen  occasionally by a clear sun set.South (fig 3) There is a long and beautiful Lagoona or Lake being about 2 miles wide, beyond it in the direction of Vera Cruz, there are high mountains and fertile plains. In the foreground there is a long tract of prarie, covered with the wild prarie grass, some chaparell bushes, with occasional  patches of low timber, and skirted on the margin of both waters with brushy trees, and one Rancho or (small) farm. [*Mond March 5th*] Weather warm, and yet no rain, but a pleasant  breeze each afternoon. Having all baggage in readiness and our bargains completed for horses and mules, we  embarked with everything belonging to our party in large canoes, in which we made the best of our way up to Laflers' Rancho 16 miles up the Rio Paneuco, to his principal farm or Haciendo, which I sketch'd as in No 4. Showing the Paneuco river, the neighboring mountain which contains its ancient remains of a past city on it and the curious forest in its foreground. This is the  best house on this river. This gentleman is an extensive landholder, his personal property extends  over more than 50 square miles, which he says he purchased some 12 or 14 years ago for $800. He came here originally from the State of Ohio. He has an immense tract, stock, grain, servants &c.and raises Sugar Cane, Coffee, bannanas, Corn, and  many other things, and is the only person I see about  this section of the country making brick. During our  short stay at this pleasant rancho, Mr Thompson, one of  our party obtained a guide over the river, and proceeded out to the ancient city upon the mountain; he reports the way to be difficult and exceedingly unpleasant, but he considered himself amply repaid in beholding some of the  scattered remains of old stone walls, parts of dwellings, implements &c. I was informed in Tampico, that a large  block of stone, appearing to have been part of a monument, was raised there, with an inscription upon the under surface, below it there was another similar block, which has not yet been removed. There are many very interesting matters there for the Antiquarian: Mr  Thompson having shot a deer, returned at Sun set with it, which  was very acceptable to our company. Our party were very much annoyed by clouds of voracious moschetoes, and other exceedingly repugnant insects swarming upon all the undergrowth and weeds of this region of country. At this Haciendo, our dinners were of the best the  country afforded, including a great variety of new dishes.Tuesd 6th Day clear and very warm; our baggage was repacked and carefully weighed; and likewise assorted for mule loads. Horses, mules, and pack saddles was the business of the day Wed 7th Day clear and hot. This morning opened with the buz of preparation for marching to Mazatlan; but for many unprepared considerations, it was postponed one day. Thursd 8th Day clear and hot. Having hired our mules, mustangs and four servants from Mr Lafler, and our guide Don Francisco, being in command as director of our order of march, as interpreter, Sub Commissary &c. and our other officers being elected -- and having carefully loaded all our arms -- we commenced our line of march, -- at 10 A.M. upon an extensive levil and variegated prairie. Westward ho! all in lively spirits; the first large city to which we  looked forward with interest, was San Louis Potosi,  a distance from Tampico of about 350 miles, though variously estimated from 3 to 400 miles according to route. The appearance of our company completely equipped with with guns, rifles, revolvers, knives, swords, &c. was anything but pleasant for a guerrilla to look at, some of which we anticipated meeting. half the day we marched upon a prairie plain, a part of whichhad no timber and scarcely any vegetation. We passed a  pleasant little lake upon which there was an immense quantity of wild game, that was easily approached. in the afternoon we got among some woodland hills, with  a small allowance of very bad water. Our road was only  a very indifferent mule path, and not passible for a  vehicle of any kind, and continues thus quite to S.L. Potosi. On the way we saw immense droves of cattle and horses, roving at large upon the prairies. In the afternoon we  passed a caravan from San Louis Potosi. The road being very dusty, the sun excessively hot, water scarce and bad,  and but little available shade; we were of course quite glad to close this days journey, in camp at a small bamboo hut, on the bank of the Rio Paneuco. - and an  interesting group of dusty travellers we were too, with  a regular saw mill appetite. Freoles, or black beans, with  coffee and corn tortelias, were served round for supper, and notwithstanding they were previously out of credit; they passed very current on this occasion. Our beds and blankets were then spread at random upon the  ground in the open air; and a guard of two set, for every two hours of the night, on the first of which I served two  hourswith my comrade Mr Bods, being from 8 to 10. An early Moon rose upon the meandering and placid waters of the beautiful Rio Paneuco, and a gentle breeze played  fitfully in the overarching foliage around over camp. This was a fit time to remind one of those pleasant evenings at home, of scenes in our native land. Friday 9th Day clear & hot. Got on march before daylight and marched 9 leagues, (27 miles) through a hot sun, dusty paths, winding hither and thither over small hills and bushy plains of no peculiar interest, with no dinner  and a short allowance of very bad limestone water. This evening we anchored again a bamboo cabin, on the banks of the Rio Paneuco, very similar to the last, and found a very short allowance of provisions at  this place. A part of our party went into the river to bathe and found the water quite warm. They were cautioned  however about Alligator gars &c, which are  sometimes dangerous. We camped again in the open air. Sat 10th Day clear & hot. Commenced our march before daylight; being 7 leagues (21 miles) for the day. Travelled most of this day over plains, covered with forest of  palm trees, with dense undergrowth of palmettos.from which the palm fans are made, this change of  scenery was new and very interesting to us. It reminded  me much of the descriptions of palm forrest in Africa and  India, frequently for miles we saw no other trees than  several varieties of the palm, sometimes scattering, and  at others compact reminding one too of the Jersey pines, when seen at a distance. These palms afford but little shade, and grow here usually to the height of from 40 to 50 feet, without branches or leaves, save only upon their very summets. An American unaccustomed to such  very singular scenes cannot comprehend fully from description the majesty they impose at first sight upon the mind of the lover of the wild in Nature. View us winding our way in single file, with baggage mules in advance, with coats off, and red flannen, as  conspicuous; with arms glistening in the mid days sun, the arrearo's or mule drivers singing out with their incessant \"mulah\", the guide ahead  smoking his cigaretto, or little paper cigar, and the  rest of the travellers following like a flock of spring birds in complete tune, and merry felicity, among dust, sunshine, and the shadeless forrests of palm. [*20*] In places however the palms, and palmettos arched over our road.and gave us a partial shade for a short period, then we would come up on an open plain, followed by a regular forrest of various trees, massive, dense, and overgrown with immense vines, and peculiar trees for occasional undergrowth; next a few small hills, then a brushy plane, followed again and again with the forrests of palm. Parrots and many other birds of gay plumage were very abundant and exceedingly noisy. Here and there the grass and brush have been fired and burned off for many miles. We encamped again at a bamboo cabin on the Rio Paneuco, very similar to the last, here again most of our party bathed in the river. I saw some diminutive watermellons at this Rancho, and helped to taste one. Our fare at this place was reasonable, but charges superior. The water is still very indifferent and strong of limestone. 11th Day clear and hot. Started early for a Rancho on the  Tamouin & Paneuco. 9 leagues (27 miles) The scenery of this day was much diversified and interesting with palms, plains, hills, gullies, brushes, and forrests. Among which I saw very many curious Banyan trees, or the wild figg tree. So curious were they, that if time had permitted I should have, certainlysketched a number of them. I think it is the same species of the Banyan tree of India. I saw several  cases of palm trees completely imbedded in the very trunks of immense Banyan trees, and being quite ornamental  to it. This tree returns from its from its branches direct  in a perpendicular line very frequently to the ground  in long cords like ropes, which take root and spring up again, in many shapes and sizes, and in many  cases more than a hundred times from one large tree. On this days march we saw several curious Mounds. We arrived at the Tamowin about 3.P.M, and after sending all baggage over with ourselves in [a] canoes,  we finished our crossing by swimming the horses & mules,  on the opposite bank we encamped at a large and  good looking Rancho, being at the junction of the  rivers Paneuco and Tamowin. Here we purchased a calf of good size for $.3.00, and prepared him accordingly, for further use upon the way. Water still unpalatable. This evening a part of our company were in to swim again. From circumstances we inferred trouble with guerrillas, but the guards were vigilant, and we left at 1.O.clock next  morning winding over way through a forest by moonlight.Mond. 12th Day clear & hot. Proceeded by early moonlight (1.O. clock) on our way for Villa de Viase. At sunrise we arrived at the first- Mountain on our way called the \"Siera Madre\" or Mother Mountain. Before entering the pass, the traveller will find a valuable warm Sulpher Spring, of great medicinal properties not far from the path. As you approach the pass, the scene is peculiar. You walk and lead your Mustangs over a rocky path, of such barbarous rudeness that you may deem it a venture for a Mountain goat, and yet your horse must be taxed with all his personal wits to puzzle his way out over loose rocks that edge over the precipice of an almost bottomless uncertainty. The mules, -they are as sharp as Chatham Yankees, for they will carry a load, where a common man would want room to tout over his own shadow. They are perfect baggage wild cats, and climb rocks with heavy loads as if they had claws, or were cammels in the desert of Arabia. We passed over one high and exceedingly dangerous precipice,  and other unpleasant places, and finally passed through a very narry and precipitous valley that meandered like the bed of a little river diagonally across the mountain, with almost the slightgrade of a rail road, and generally not much over 300 feet in width, but steep and of great height with timber on each side edging up the mountains, the meanderings of this cavern-valley  with its hight cliffs, and little coves and passes, gave to the whole scene a peculiar wildness and Sublimity. We scared up five young deer among the rocks; It was in this mountain pass that from report, we first  anticipated some Mexican Indians, or Guerillas; in this pass they could sweep and be safe; and although our guns were several times fired, none made their appearance to us. After crossing the mountain pass, we came upon an undulating country still uninhabited, though in many places of a very rich soil, covered sometimes with good timber and now and then prarie grass, with occasional barrens of wild and cavernous limestone rocks. Entrances to caves are to be seen, and in one place a romantic spot, an immense well of an oval form descends perpendicularly through limestone rocks to a great debth. Some ancient trees bend gracefully over and around its mouth. To day also, I found the remains of an ancient town and the appearance of an ancient fort on our way to the village de Viase. Revd Mr Woods and myself passed on in the advance of the trainMarch, 1849.  a mile or two, with the view of arriving at the village in  advance of the train. on the way just as we had pas a  slight bend of the road, we saw five uncouth looking Mexicans sitting on the bank of a dry creek; the wispered suspiciously until we came beside them, when they all arose at once with sticks, and gathered around us, supposing something rong on foot, I drew my gun from its sheath, and exhibited also my revolver and knife. Mr Woods prepared himself also by exarming his gun &c. These fellows followed us a short distance evidently meditating our arms, when they fell  off from us on being told that many Americans were just behind. We arrived in the village early in the afternoon, and found Mr Grants division just on the point of leaving for S.L. Potosi. This being the place where all our horses had to be shod for the mountains to come. We encamped on the village plaza, pitched our tents, prepared our own food, &c. Tuesd 13th Day hot and clear, examined the appearance of the village with friends, and obtained a good bowl of coffee two eggs and bread on the plaza for 1 Real, 12 1/2 cts. We have discovered that  Milk, Eggs, freeoles, tortelias, Oranges, and Coffee may be  readily obtained at almost every place; all of which  are very cheap, except coffee. On the Plaza of thisvillage there stands the remains of an Ancient Catholic Church. The Cupola is yet in a tollerable State of preservation and 3 bells yet hang in it of a very Anti- quated appearance. Upon its summet shrubs, cactus, grass may be seen as luxuriant as upon Terra firma. Vide sketch No 5. To the right of it is a long bamboo  building thatched with palmetoes; in it the Catholic citizens hold their Service. From appearances within we judge this chappel to contain more real wealth than many of those magnificent edifices of the States. This day was occupied in Shoeing our horses. Mr. Lafler of Tampico came in the village some 90 miles from his Rancho in order to have them properly attended too, the Shoes having been brought here from Tampico. The price of Shoeing here is from 3 to 5 dollars per horse, in the States about one dollar. Here they most generally throw the animal upon the  ground and tie him there with ropes. The Smith shops and other mechanical departments appear more like burlesques than the representation of a half civilized people. This morning I ascended the cupola of the plaza ruins and then beheld a beautiful view of the Siera Madre Mountains 12 miles westward as in Sketch No. 6.The foreground from the mountain was nearly a levil plane, intersperced here and there with apparent clearings, which in several cases proved to be small open and natural praries, probably never cleared by the hand of man, as they were not much used. A small rapid and romantic river passes under a deep bluff beside the village, where our party were again into bathe, as the day was excessively hot and the water agreeable. The peaks of the Siera Alta, appeared like a cloud in the distance. In offering a pass to the  traveller these mountains are very high and formidable. Just as I had completed this sketch the priest of the parish a very pleasant man ascended the tower and expressed much pleasure at finding me sketching, and thereupon requested me to descend and dine with him, to which I complied with much pleasure, in descending the tower in a shady recess, he placed my arms around  himself he also embraced me, with much feeling, and said that he liked the Americans. His dinner was served  up in the best Mexican style, with wine and numerous new dishes, served in about 8 or10 changes of plates. I left much gratified with his hospitality. Our horses being in readiness, at 4.P.M. we commenced our marchtoward the foot of the Siera Madre Mountains. In leaving and crossing the river by the ford, it was very gratifying to see about 90 or 100 Mexicans upon the high bluffs and along the road to see us out and bid us a friendly adieu, and Adios, adios, adios, was echoed here, there and yonder, which signifies - \"to God\"- we commend you. We travelled some 10 miles this evening and camped in a wild spot about 2 miles from the foot of the mountain. My sketchbook, a satchell, and a coat belonging to Mr Sayre, were lost after dark before camping, but 3 of us returned by moonlight before sun rise and found them. Our camp fire looked really interesting this evening with the sentinals parading around the sleepers who where rolled  up in blankets; who constantly watched among the timbers and bushes for enemy and wholves, the latter of which made themselves known before daylight. [*Wedn 14th.*] Day hot & clear. Arose before before daylight and proceeded to the Siera Madre Mountain. As we ascended, I observed numerous scattering mounds, parts of old walls &c, the timber became large and dense. I believe that there is a spring (the only one from Tampico to S Louis Potosi) not far from the road to the right as you ascend the mountain.our path over the mountain was in ascent by windings about 3 miles, and nearly the same in descending over the opposite side and other hills. The whole scenery was wild beyond description. Could this road or path be exhibited in a civilized country, it would be considered dangerous even for a mountain goat; how then shall I describe it, when a painter would consider it beyond a just representation if skillfully drawn. We lead our horses up the  steep precipitous masses, jumping and scrambling from  rock to rock sometimes two feet perpendicularly. The most ragged and cragged ledges, holes, chasms, and peaks that  the mind could picture for feats in horsemanship. Reader! you have doubtless seen nominally bad roads in the States, but they convey only a faint idea of the  hardships you must encounter in passing the formidable crags upon these mountains of distracted rudeness. Having surmounted the first Series, we descended upon  similar sharp and pointed edges into a wild and  romantic cove, leading off over and around other more  passable hills, in full view of numerous mountains ranging at random in every direction, until we reached the Ranch la Pier, by a small lakeupon a beautiful plane, and here we encamped for the night, having arrived early in the afternoon. The proprietor of the Rancho, is an Alcalde of wealth, and a man of affable manners. Before sun set we ascended a neighboring hill and sketched scene No. 7. including a large assemblage of distant mountains. The setting sun cast back their shadows upon the planes, as I descended, and lent a passing beauty to them ever to be remembered. From advice given us by the Alcalde, it was thought advisable to change our rout over the mountains to San Louis Potosi, by a nearer and more safe direction. The Mexican forces, and Indians or Guerrillas, being  upon the regular route, which would cause us trouble. The first division having gone that way unadvised, they met with difficulties, detention, and considerable danger. Thurs 15th Day clear & hot. Entered upon the nearer route, and passed palm forrests, old fortifications, and a fine little river, where  we filled our canteens with refreshing and cool water, the best from Tampico, and accomplished a long march and 6 or 7 formidable mountains of worse paths than any previously travelled. To describe our labours on these volcanic rocks of gothic masonry, would be romantic indeed.but suffice it to be said that this days march was  the most wild rugged and exhausting of any to San Louis Potosi. On this route I had the pleasure of discovering a  magnificent cavernous Amphitheatre of several thousand feet in diameter, and about 300 feet in perpendicular  debth, covered below with dense timber, and overhung with high arching cliffs of great magnificence. Our mountain scenery today was exceedingly grand though we enjoyed it but little owing to the difficult passes to be encountered. Many of the mountains had no timber, nor even vegetation upon them; being vast masses of rude brown rocks particularly upon their summets. Had time permitted, I should have sketched some of these alpine scenes of barrenness for the information and curiosity of my friends and readers. They are totally unlike anything I ever before saw  in point of complete barrenness and appeared really savage. At sunset we descended into a romantic valley and wound around several Sugarloaf hills, by dark into the beautiful village of San Nicholas, where we encamped upon a pleasant plaza of grass in the midst of the village and at the foot of a large and imposing mountain.but suffice it to be said that this days march was the most wild rugged and exhausting of any to San Louis Potosi.

At sun set we descended into a romantic valley and wound round several Sugarloaf hills, by dark into the beautiful village of San Nicholas, where we encamped upon a pleasant plaza of grass in the midst of the village and at the foot of a large and imposing Mountain.seen bearing much resemblance to a volcano. Whilst watering our horses at a pond in this valley, two suspicious Mexicans appeared, one over the pond, and the other near us apparently examining our arms, &c. and in a short time one of them made bold to tell two of our party that  he was one of a party defeated by the Mexican Government, and that they were many, who were now in persuit of  plunder, both of them were handsomely dressed, and rode upon first class animals. We turned to the left from this interesting valley, through a pass in the hills similar to  No 9. when we came in view of the beautiful and-- romantic village of Tortugas, or village of turtles, where we arrived at 4 P.M. and located ourselves in a  small brush school house, upon a small riding ground well adapted to defence, as an attack of the Guerrillas was looked for, as quite certain during the night. Many of the inhabitants collected around us with curiosity and pleasure, as they hoped we would be of service to them in case of an attack of the Guerrillas or robbers. We were all in anticipation of a fight, when we saw a small fire upon the summit of a neighboring mountain, supposed to be a signal light. Guns, pistols &c were allwith here and there patches of stunted vegetation, growing among the wild mountain rocks. Among these I saw a number of strange and interesting trees, curious plants, magueys, palmettoes, coco's, and a strange fruit resembling the pine apple, being twice as large, and filled with numerous small soft white fruits, much resembling in appearance and taste the common chesnut, which were very abundant on one of the mountains. I also saw a shrub or bean plant bearing flowers, resembling skeins of white & red silk, from 1 to 2 inches in thickness, and from 4 to 6 inches in length. On this days march we passed through many very peculiar mountains, scenes of interest. No 9 (sketch.) was taken on horseback whilst passing into the valley of corn. No 10. is a view of the Valle de Maise, or valley of corn, looking to the north. This valley is about one mile in width, and many in length. The hills upon either side are nothing of nearly void of vegetation, the whole valley is divided into large fields for corn, and well improved with stone fences. The soil is rich and corn flourishes here luxuriantly. Far on the northern horizon a high mountain wasall of which grew from 4 to 15 feet in height, and chiefly among the interstices of the rocks. It appeared to be a  section of country almost useless for any purpose, and it  really appeared strange, how such a barren wilderness of  of thorns could be at all inhabited where water was  also very bad and scarce; in the afternoon we travelled among clouds of dust, with a hot sun and but little breeze. before sunset we encamped under a tree, beside, a desolate mud dwelling upon a deasert plane, much like a scene in the desert of Arabia, appearing quite as barren and  forlorn, as the immagination could well picture as in sketch No 13. A large old fashioned rope and pulley well, was in the  vicinity, at which about 40 Mexican women, were engaged in drawing water, and carrying it away in large earthen jars upon their heads, bearing a striking resemblance to the old Egyptian costoms, in dress, color, and manners. At this place we fared slim and paid well for it. Sund 18th   Day clear and warm. Proceeded on our journey at 6.A.M. very  anxious to get out of this barren and sandy wilderness. and travelled nearly all day over diversified planes of  limestone, palms, maguays, casters, some timber, and for a  mile or two, for the first time a woodland of beautiful cedars.put in the best order, our camp fire put out, and two guards put on duty. The Alcalde paid us a friendly visit, and many of the inhabitants brought us cheap provissions, and the night passed off without trouble. [*Sat. 17th.*] Day clear and warm. The inhabitants came in numbers to bid us a friendly adios. I pencil'd sketches No 11. and 12. just before leaving showing on No 11. our position in camp at the school house, and an opposite view looking South. Oranges flourish here, and are  very cheap, eggs are plentiful, with many useful articles of provissions. Soon after leaving this pleasant village, we ascended several large and barren hills, and in a few hours descended a very romantic pass down upon prarie plains and cultivated fields. our views on this days journey were extensive new diversified and interesting. We came to a  small village of a very romantic appearance, beside a little stream of water, where at first the inhabitants were much terrified at our appearance. We saw but little timber, during the whole day, the planes and  hills, being almost covered with wild cactus, prickley pears, and the short scrubby palms, etc.At intervals for several miles, the ground was as white as the very snow of a northern winter, having a saline taste, in places, in others that of Epsom Salts, and as fine as the very best flour. Caverns were beneath, for we  could often hear the footsteps of our horses echoing beneath, and now and then a chasm or deep pit would  appear. When timber appeared in the usual form of groups or clusters, it usually had a singular appearance, much resembling extensive Apple, and  Peach orchards. The country had conspicuous marks of a volcanic origin upon a limestone foundation. We were almost constantly in sight of distant ranges of lofty and rugged mountains, lending romance to the day. and now and then large planes, covered with prairie grass would extend for before the eye to the mountains skirted here and there with pleasant shady woodlands. We arrived at the Hacienda about 4. P.M. and were  gratified to find it a place much superior to the last,  not only for provisions, but also for shade and comfort. About 9.O.clock this morning we arrived at a place on the valley plane, where a stream of clear and very strong limestone water meandered from a small lake, and in a short distancedisappeared beneath the ground; this water though clear and cold, was so strongly impregnated with the Carbonate of lime, that though we were very thirsty, we could scarcely drink it. During a temporary halt, I sketch'd this lake No. 12 [*14*], and its vicinity southward. Game was plentiful here, and  several of our party delay'd some on account of it. Mr Sherman, one of the same , remained there so long that  in persuit of our caravan he missed the path and  was lost for a day and a half suffering greatly from exposure and other great dangers; after some delay, expense,  and trouble in scouring the country in various directions with a Mexican guide, he was at last found, much fatigued frightened, and sick, having encountered considerable perils. I remained some time behind the company in waiting for  Sherman, as long as I felt it safe from missing the way  myself, expecting him to come up upon this path, [during that time I sketched scene No 14. a high] on our right there was a high mountain [to] [the North] bearing the marks of a large volcano. Some of our party were in to bathe again this evening, but as our journey has elevated us much, the water is now becoming cooler especially each night, which is cold enough for two or three blankets, whilst  the mid day sun is quite hotMond 19th Day warm and clear. Proceeded on our journey at 7.O. clock. sMuch of this days journey was very similar to the last, at times winding among barren hills, small planes of cactus, thorns scattering palms, gullies and rocks, with small groves of peculiar trees of a stunted growth. Before sun set we crossed a beautiful and fertile plane under cultivation with corn, and haulted for a short time at a large well on one of the fields one and a half liles from, and in full view of the beautiful little town of Ceretus de San Juan; at the suburbs of which we encamped within a large yard for the  night. Before day light had left the hills of Ceretus, I passed through several parts of the town, and Sketched the church and plaza as in No 15. Showing the valley and hills eastward, over which we had passed during the after part of the day. The appearance of this little town is quite genteel the houses being mostly constructed of Stone and frequently whitewashed and as often secluded in pleasant Shady yards and groves of the trees and shrubs peculiar to this country.Tuesd 20th  Day warm and clear. Proceeded on our journey at 6.O.clock. Just as we were leaving the yard the horse belonging to Mr Thompson, taking fright at some object ran off through the yard, and brok his rifle into many small pieces, Mr T.--escaping unhurt. About 1 mile from  Ceretus, looking westward, I sketched scene No 16. showing the barren hills, a hacienda to the right, and the little clusters of bushes, dotting the ground like miniature islands. We were among the hills and ravines all day, and passed up one very interesting pass between barren mountains which was several  miles in length. On the way before entering this pass,  and at the commencement of a fine broad road, we  halted for a short time at a large Hacienda, called San  E Pedro No 17. having westward a beautiful mountain view, south the cultivated fields and distant hills, and around the dwelling several beautiful groves, over the principal door was painted in large letters, \"Casa Particular\". It being a public house or hotel of the  Mexican order. Having ascended through peculiar scenes of the passes, to the summet of the mountains, we then passed a long time over a wild rocky and entirely desolatewilderness, almost entirely destitute of the smallest vegetation, except in some particular spots, where small stone & mud huts of misery were now and then to be seen. Before descending we passed a small mud village in a little rocky and desolate ravine; with only a few cactus, thorns, and stunted brush, but no regular timber about it. It looked much like solitude and misery. The road has now become excellent, and for the first time we found it graded and paved as a regular road up the mountain. Wooden crosses are plentiful and conspicuous, they are more numerous now than on the way back to Tampico; Sometimes two or three in sight of each other may be seen and particularly on this days march. We are told that these crosses are erected upon the particular spots, where travelers have been murdered. if so, this is decidedly a great country. As we descended the mountain, winding our way down a dangerous pass, a beautiful plane, with a range of barren mountains 15 miles westward, appeared before us, which I hastily sketched as our party descended to the plane, as in number 18. This plane is about 15 miles in width, and almost entirely covered with a brush peculiar to this country.This plane, of the valley is quite level and of very great length, the camino that crosses it, is at least 100 feet broad, and would be an elegant road for travel if not so abundantly supplied with dust and sand. Our party were so much enveloped in dust, that during a portion of the time some of them were not distinguishable at the distance of a few rods. Clouds of dust arose high in the air, and marked in places the spots where persons were moving on many parts of the plane. Such scenes have however been long familiar to us from the very city of Tampico. At sun set we arrived at the \"Meson De Fern\" a public house called Pestelius located in a desert of sand, a few miles from a village to the north west and off from the road. At this place, we found Capt Grants' division of the Camargo Company, who met us in a sociable manner as old friends, the two divisions having taken different roads to San Louis Potosi.. Mr Chevallias' party of 5 having also arrived the whole Camargo Company were again together. At night, a high wind arose and gave us a complete storm of dust, exceeding anything of the kind that I have ever before witnessed in any country, reminding one of the desert of Arabia.Wednd 21st Day warm and clear. Capt. Grants division, left before sunrise in order to reach San Louis Potosi before night. Our company proceeded on the way an hour after, as we did not design pressing our horses and mules with a very long days march. Nos 19 and 20 are exterior and  interior views of the desert house where we camped. To the right of the house, there is a large well, which is deserving of notice; two or three hoses are fastened by beams to a vertical shaft, which by 8 right angle sticks move a horizontal beam, to which there is a wheel about 12 feet in diameter, with ropes and  about 20 leather buckets, for raising water from the  well to a trough, and from thence into a stone bason  about 60 feet square, and 8 or 10 feet in debth. This water was fair and cool, and very desirable for the country. Such wells are not frequent, and found only occasionally at the large Haciendo's or Ranchoe's of the wealthy. Water on this road from Tampico to  San Louis Potosi, is scarce, and in almost every instance very unpalatable, muddy, and dangerous to the stranger. It is therefore nescessary for travellers to be cautious in drinking the water along this route                                                                      in particular. This days journey was very similar to the last, with hills and dusty roads, with a hot sun, brushy planes, thorns, and large cactus of various forms, &c. Mountains of barren rocks were seen all day, but we travelled chiefly upon the planes. About 4 in the afternoon we arrived at the Rancho de los Soledad, previous to which I sketched scene No. 21 as we descended to the valley in which this rancho is located, This plane is very wide, and a very considerable length, on this plane about 30 miles to the left is located the city of San Louis Potosi, in full view of large Mountains, though not within several miles of any of them. No. 22 is a sketch of the Haciendo or \"Rancho de los  Solidad\", and its neighboring mountain, which I sketched before sun set, this scene is looking S. East. We encamped opposite to this in a large Mud wall with appartments for travellers as in Sketch No. 23. The inhabitants are now becoming less friendly than they were back over the mountains. And are decidedly against the Americans in the popular feeling, and have occasionally expressed those feelings with insults, and a few words of contempt, which some of them have learned from the American deserters, in the English language. We have seen a number of these contempitible shadows of white men and almost as often heard their curses, or indecent language, but we have generally left them unnoticed. At this rancho we saw a large amount of arms and lances, with an American Rifle, pistols, swords &c which led us to suspicion the character of the place strongly; we however kept our Arms and Sentinels in good trim, and were ready at the word, to show them that in defence we were the same original Americans that they might have before read about. Had our numbers been small enough to suit their taste, I have no doubt but that a fight would have resulted judging from all circumstances, questions, &c. Being in the neighborhood of S. L. Potosi, it is now absolutely nescessary to be constantly on your gard for all shapes of thieves, Robbers, Guerillos, &c., etc, etc. who appear to compose a large proportion of the population. [*Thursd 22nd*]  We left the Rancho, this morning at 3. O. clock for San  Louis Potosi, the road was broad, and lined with cactus, from 5 to 15 feet in height. We were all awake for any attack on the way. Having travelled 15 miles by 1/2 past 8.O. clock A.M. we entered the Splendid and singular city of San Louis Potosi, having passed through a beautiful little village before entering Potosi. The city is situated upon a large and beautiful plane, which is under good cultivation, and is for several miles in every direction; divided into regular right angle  \"streets and roads. The fences of the roads, if they may be so called are composed of the high pentangular cactus, growing in single stems of about 5 inches diameter to a  height of about 8, 10, or 15 feet, and frequently so close together that it is generally capable of shutting out the smallest animal. The average width of the streets are about 30 feet. A member of large and handsome species of trees range along them, with which I am not familiar, one of which resembles in bark, limb, and  site, the Locust, with leaf of a small fern. Another, has the shape and height of a poplar, with the denseness of the black thorn hedges of the States; it is a  beautiful tree of a dark green color, and very ornamental. The maguay is another peculiar plant, very abundant here; I have seen fences made of them extending many miles at a time, and very common everywhere  onour way from Tampico. All these interesting plants, trees &c. with a large number that would be  difficult to describe, but which nevertheless are exceedingly beautiful, belong to this country and are so abundant as at times to cover many miles in compact masses, so much so that it would be difficult for a man to pass among them as they all, with but little exception possess luxuriant crops of  thorns. All these species crowd the roads and surround the fields as you pass into San Louis Potosi. I also for the first time saw two peach trees in full blossom in a beautiful garden at the suburbs of the city. And many beautiful flowers of singular beauty were in full bloom likewise and filled the air with the richness of their morning fragrance. Several fine fields of ripe barley added to the view, their mellow orange hues, whilst, the plough (a rude woodden concern) was busy beside. The Orange, Lemons, and fig trees were also handsome when blended with their fruits, beneath other more conspicuous trees, among which was one called the Peru, another the China tree, andyet another larger and decorated with more exquisite brilliance than I have ever before witnessed. all these with their charming colors and luxuriance bent gracefully over our dusty roads as we passed into the great central metropolis of Potosi. The morning sun had already arrisen upon the domes, towers and minarets of Potosi, as our company entered it from the North. There was so much of the grand and the humble combined, that I could not but remark its resemblance to what I had read of St Petersburg and Moscow, as described by travellers in Russia. After wending in single file our tortuous way amid dense crowds of strange brown faces, around the various streets of the city we at last took up our quarters at the St Anthony house, which was commodious and  constructed strictly after the Mexican order, and one of the first hotels in the city, though, not by any means adapted to the ideas of Americans, being very similar to sketches Nos. 19. and 20. The suburbs of the city (which are very extensive) are almost entirely composed of miserable looking one story flat roof'd mud dwellings of a dilapidated appearance which are much inferior to  the [*34*]very lowest order of dwellings found in any part of the  States, and contrast in a very striking manner with the numerous splendid sanctuaries, public buildings, towers, domes, and superfluous grandeur of the interior city. None of our company even dreamed of the surprising splendours, which broke so suddenly upon them, when they entered the thronged plazas amid the thousands of vacant gazers who seem'd to view us as some unearthly intruders, just draft among them from some other plannet. Our ideas were never so much unhinged at when too closely crowded by dense throngs of starving Mexicans, who with wondrous eyes and  open mouths, Knew not in decency where to end their extravagant curiosity. As we entered the  streets were quick ly thronged, the windows and  iron gratings filled with Seniorettas or Ladies, the doors with wise heads and muchatcha's of boys with some upon the very house tops, to the  Americans enter into the precincts of their almost forbidden walls of China. An unfriendly feeling towards the Americans was soon evident from their language  as it was a day of religious ceremonies, and rest from labor, the church and plaza was thronged, by Mexicans dressed in their holliday best. We passed through this pleasant town, without halting and ascended a steep, high and rugged mountain at the immediate suburbs of the town. On looking back towards Amattitan, distant 14  miles to the South east and Tekelah at its base I hastily sketched the view as in No 59. On ascending this mountain I saw an animal of the Lizard Species about 2 feet in  length lying upon a large boulder rock in a ravine. After ascending we passed several miles through a  a deep, [and] very narrow, and crooked ravine among the highland hills; it was perfectly adapted to the purposes of Ladrones or Robbers, and has been recently the theatre of bloody deeds, robberies, &c. Here jet black Quartz began to appear plentiful after passing in single file for Several miles under the arches and bluffs of this wild and narrow ravine, we descended into a small and pretty valley, where there was a small farm, green fields and some water, from  this we ascended large hills, almost composed of  [*35*]the same brittle jet black quartz, before named. So much so, that it was hard upon the feet of our animals, we again descended into a gently sloping valley of about two miles in width, at the far northern end of which we could see the interesting Lake of Madalena, which I sketched on a nearer approach as in No 60. Showing the town of Madalena on the margin of the Lake, beyond which that welcome sheet of water with its interesting mountain scenery appeared, reminding one much of similar scenes in Italy and Switzerland; and rather unlike many other Mexican towns. At this place we stopped in a comfortable mason overnight, halting about 4 P.M. An opportunity offering I went and upon the margin of the lake and sketched view No 61 looking west among the mountains over which the sun was setting. Also No 62 looking south east towards part of the town Madalena is a town of a shady and pleasant appearance. Most of its streets are narrow and crooked, but well shaded in general. The plaza, was of good size and had a fine large antiquated church upon the south eastern side of it. Around which there was a large crowd of worshippers,uncivil manners, and in two of our party being stoned upon the city plaza; all of which we readily discovered and were particularly cautious, in being upon our guard, whilst we were frequently rendering civilities for incivilities. To these however we are happy to state that there were a number of exceptions, among the higher classes, and the better informed, which gave us a better opinion of Potosi, than we otherwise should  have had. We were nearly three days in this interesting city during which time whilst our guide was preparing fresh mustangs &c for our further journey to Mazatlan; and having some opportunities, I availed myself of them in visiting and sketching some of the massive and beautiful churches &c, having first obtained permission from an alcalde's clerk in the Governors' Palace, to visit and sketch as I wish'd. I proceeded in company with an American friend about 1 1/2 miles south from  the city, towards the Mosa Mountain, where from the remains of an old mud fort, I sketched the domes  &c of the city as in No 24. nearly all of which belong to magnificent churches erected many years past by the Spaniards at enormous costs, and decorated  in theinterior with gorgeous and the most exhorbitant displays of wealth and splendour that the human immagination could well conceive of, and far exceeding any thing of the kind to be found in the States. An open plane of more than a mile in extent each way extended between the fort and the city, upon which several hundred Mexican soldiers were exercising with targets, drilling &c. At this time large forces are concentrated here, who appear to be preparing for political struggles for power. To the right of this open plane, there are four parallel rows of the beautiful Alamo trees forming a shady and a very pleasant walk of about one mile from the city proper southward to the front  of the magnificent sanctuary (Santoario) as in fig 25. At each end and along this walk there are handsomely ornamented fountains. No 25 is a view of the Sanctuary and Mosa Mountains from the same position, where fig 24 was taken. A nearer view of the Sanctuary was then taken from the front near a fountain, as in fig 26, including two fountains two neat gardens, and the style of seats surrounding the principal fountain. The workmanship upon this magnificent edifice appears to be a contribution of the various orders ofArchitecture which in execution I believe to be superior to any thing similar which I have seen in the States. Not even excepting Trinity Church in New York, and composed of a hard red sand stone very similar to the one named. This church though over a mile from the city was under military guard, from whom I asked permission to enter but was told that the chief key of the Sanctuary was in the posession of the Captain, who was out drilling his  men upon the plane beforementioned. On returning to the city we passed a number of handsome edifices of  singular and antiquated appearance, but my opportunities limited me in sketching many of them. The streets were thronged in almost every direction, and should one attempt a sketch in their presence, a crowd of noisy gabbling superstitious men, women, and children, would soon compell a retreat, at the risk of being stoned, amid the jeers, and language suiting degraded and grossly ignorant minds. I was told there were over fifty handsome Sanctuaries or churches in this city, which from appearances I doo not doubt. None but the Catholic religion is tolerated here as in other parts of the Republic, and in passing each Sanctuary, even upon the opposite side of the street, the person is required to takeoff his hat, and retain it in his hand, until he has passed the door of the Sanctuary, otherwise he is liable to be stoned at the shortest notice; if nothing worse may happen him. I'm entering the church during service he is required to kneel, and to accompany respectfully in the ceremonies of the church. The interior splendors of these numerous churches, I could not describe in justice within my present compass. Their displays are gorgeous in the highest degree of man's ingenuity; and frequently exhibit much of the Theatrical; in some instances the walls and high gothic roof, being entirely covered with thousands of gothic (relief) devices, are entirely gilt with gold or silver leaf, until the whole interior glitters like a solid golden palace, with richly ornamental chandaliers, lights of various colors, hundreds of Statues of life size, adorned in robes of brilliant colors, gems, in great profusion, magnificent organs, select gallaries for the paintings, relicts, and statues of the saints, in one apartment of the St Domingo Sanctuary I was shown the bones of saints, and such other things as would fill a volume to describe.On returning to the main plaza, I sketched the Palace  of the governor as in fig 27. a crowd of noisy belligerents soon manifested a a jeering aspect, which compelled me  to finish my sketch rather hastily. I then passed off hastily until I had eluded the noisy crowd of  ignorammus's and by permission getting upon the  roof of a house. I sketched therefrom the beautiful  and very extensive Sanctuary of \"San Francisco\" as in  fig 28. showing its domes, cupolas, and spires as it appeared from the North east corner. Its bells  are numerous of many tones, and remarkably fine; the  interior like an immense museum, is crowded, with  wealth, and splendours beyond description. It has  as near as I can judge over, one thousand apartments,   a part of which are very elegant in their styles, guildings,  statues, paintings, stuccoed works, altars, tombs, vaults,  organs, galleries, painted domes, stained glass, chandeliers, massive gilt gothic works &c. &c. It covers a large  square, and is almost a royal city of itself. I after proceeded  to the Church and College of St. Josephs, which I  sketched as in No 29. My visits also extended to the magnificent  Sanctuary of St. Domingo, the front of which wasGuarded by a large mounted Cannon, and in a house, beside it several hundred soldiers. The interior of this great  church was the most gorgeous I ever beheld, its walls  and gothic ceiling was so gilt with gold leaf, as to appear  like one immense golden gothic palace. The Captain  of this division politely accompanied me through the  church, explaining its sacred relicts, &c. Among which  I saw immages of Angels, about 4 feet in height appearing to be cast of Gold, encased in splendid cases over  the grand Altar. A similar image of the Virgin  and Saviour sitting upon a throne of very massive  silver clouds, over which was an immense dome  inlaid with porcelain of rich colors. There was A large and  beautiful Organ upon a highly ornamented gallery, resting  upon Lions, that seemed watching the congregation,  And numerous saints in richest robes, (of nearly full  size) were to be seen in every direction. The interior  forum of the church was that of a cross, having two  magnificent Altars. I asked permission to sketch this  fine church from the little plaza front, but was  told that it could not be granted, without a  special permit. I then proceeded to sketch theyards, with numbered cells, in which from 10 to 30 may sleep on a brick pavement, having their own blankets of course. There is usually a cook shop in one of these cells, called a \"Fonda,\" where coffee, meat &c. are prepared to order, and usually well charged for; although the cooking may be very inferior to any thing in the States. In chocolate, however, the Mexicans excel, and sometimes in coffee, and especially in light sweet cakes. March  25th.  (Sunday)  Our company (of between 40 and 50,)  Left San Louis Potosi this morning at half past five, in double file presenting to the gazing crowds quite a military face, as red flannel was very conspicuous on almost every man, for almost every coat was off, it being clear moderately warm, and very dusty for a time. In the distance the city appeared beautiful and interesting. We soon entered upon open and barren rolling hills, where I found several handsome specimens of agate scattered among gravel. I neither heard of, or saw any of the silver mines of this State, though I believe them to exist in Durango, Zacatecas, and the state of San Louis Potosi, as large silver trains pass down to Tampico from this country, every few weeks. [*38A*]about 10 miles from San Louis, we entered upon some very rocky hills, into deep ravines, several narrow vallies and through narrow passes, with a cross here and there at short intervals, marking the spot where some traveller has been murdered, and his remains, if poor, deposited beneath. Our company was composed of over 40 American two Spanish guides, 8 Arrearos' or mule drivers, (Mexican) and 14 pack mules to carry our baggage allowing 150lbs. to each mule in order to travel with speed and safety. Our guns, pistols, swords, knives, &c. were all ready for immediate use, and were kept in excellent order, and many of our boys made the vallies echo with their jovial songs whilst passing, at the same time keeping an eye for any vagrant Guerrillas among the cliffs and brushes. One of the narrow vallies through which we passed during this day was peculiarly romantic, whilst a broad creek filling nearly the width of this valley of precipices, meandered with it; the bed of this creek, was in most places almost dry, so that we travelled some miles upon beds of gravel. At one place, on passing up the side of a precipitous, volcanic hill, I saw a very great quantity of handsome Geods of Calcedony, scatteredchief plaza looking eastward, including the fountain The Parroquia, a fine church, and a small part of   St Domingo east of it. A crowd of idle male and female spectators soon assembled around me bobbing continually their ugly phiz's directly in my face, so as interrupt, and intercept the view I was sketching -- presently two officers in military uniform, arrested me, and proceedded with me to an Alcalde's office, at the left base of the Governors' Palace. He wished to know  if I had a permit to sketch, I informed him that I had from the Praefectas' Clerk; upon which he discharged me and sent an officer (in uniform) to accompany me to my former seat on the Plaza, who stood by me with drawn sword, and like a gallant man kept men, women, and boys, at full bey, until I had finished my task, when he left me with a polite bow, &c. No 30, represents that sketch on the chief plaza. This plaza is almost always densely crowded by  all grades and classes of people, who stare as much as Americans, as though they were Bedouin Arabs; No 31. is a red sand stone fountain, which I sketched in the Southern port of the city at the head of the Allamo                                           walk before described.It is much of the time crowded by visitors for water, No 32. is the chief market plaza; upon this plaza are numerous Doric pillars, well finished from red sand rock, it is intended in time to place a roof upon them so as to shelter the market to be held therein. This view is looking north, at the present time the markets are held around the principal building. A good cup of coffee can be had here for a Mordeau 6 1/4 ct and mellons with many other things proportionably cheap. At this date 25th March, water mellons &c. are plentiful and cheap; the markets appeared flush with delicious fruits, oranges, mellons, cantelopes, bannannas, &c. etc; but no apples or peaches; no walnuts, chesnuts, or hickory nuts, yet similar though better than the market of Tampico. The scenery about San Louis Potosi is in places romantic and interesting when combined with the distant mountain scenery of the Southwest; the contrast of mud huts with splendid edifices and the superb residences of the wealthy are very striking and is the first thing to be observed by every traveller. At this place, they are decidedly hostile to theAmericans, partly I presume from the late war and in part from religious education. At evening the  Host, or priests, pass around in a fine carriage, drawn by mules; before which a number are seen walking, each carrying his candle, whilst several small bells, are tinkling to the heavy toll of deep tone'd bells of the Sanctuary every person male, female, young & old, must Kneel to  the host whilst passing This is a strict religious  ceremony, the nonobservance of which brings at once  upon the head of the disobedient immediate dangers  either in being stoned, or possibly something worse,  besides inculcating the ill will of the observers. In  San Louis, though there are English, French, and  some Americans, yet they are much more strict  in Religious observances than in Tampico, and  Americans should be more on their guard in  passing into the interior of Mexico and westward. As near as I could ascertain, the population of  San Louis Potosi, is about 75 thousand. The proportion of which are illitterate Mexicans of the Indian  race, called Mexican Indians. They are usually clothed  indifferently, live similar in mud huts, upon mud  floors, andlead a servile life, or one of complete indolence. Our Company remained 3 days in San Louis in order to purchase some fresh Animals, shoe others, and prepare for our further progress to Mazatlan. The two divisions with others joined in order to leave Potosi together, so as to make a display of arms, as we were informed that 70 armed guerrillas had preceeded us to the mountain passes in order to rob us, as it was currently reported here that we were in posession of a large amount of gold, and going to California to remain. It is well known that a large population of robbers live in San Louis Potosi, whose chief business is to watch and rob travellers, which makes robberies every day affairs in this country. The Mexican Indian population of this part of the Republic, seeing the monopolies of the government, have rebelled and endeavored to first down the present government with that pretext, and at the same time committing gross outrages and robberies under that cloak, by themselves. I am not aware of any Hotel in the American style existing in the whole city of San Louis, Masons or public houses exist there, which consists of squarefor at least a half mile upon the pass, No 33. is a hasty sketch taken offhand in passing a part of this interesting valley, having a large gravel bed in the foreground No 34. is a sketch of curious mountain looking west, from the summet of a gently sloping prairie hill, after having ascended from the narrow passes, and large hills on the east to this much more elevated country. In the afternoon we came upon an extensive open prairie with a gentle slope of miles, without timber and covered with parched grass, so that there was no shade, with an abundance of dust flying in considerable clouds. Several times during the day, Mexicans, richly dressed, and well mounted upon firey steeds, would ride into our ranks, bow politely, talk for a time, and then disappear, we judged them to be the guerrilla spies, and took good care to show them our determination and strength of arms. Just before sunset we arrived at the Hacienda of Tepetate, the proprietor being hostile to the Americans, would not permit us to occupy the Mason, so that we were compelled to camp out not withstanding the night proved to be very cold; we raised our camp fires, and soon prepared excellent though plain suppers, which took their usual round in messes. A strict guard was set, and the1849. March. night passed off without molestation, although anticipated before sunset I took sketch No 35 of Tepetate Hacienda. (Monday)  26th  Day clear and warm. Commenced March this morning at 6. O clock. The scenery ahead was extensive, pretty, and interesting. Several of our men were on the  sick list to day, but nothing very serious, except one man who had his arm broken some days back of San Louis Potosi, but he is now rapidly improving. Our journey today extended 18 leagues, the same as yesterday and one horse lost on this days' march, on every day event with the numerous trains on this route to Gaudalaxara. During the day we passed over a hilly country and  then upon a gently rolling country covered with immense fields of wild cactus, prickly pears, and other thorny plants usually from 5 to 10 feet in height, and often extending thus as far as the eye could reach, without any relief of other plants, &c. I found some pretty specimens of Chalcedony by the way. At evening we arrived at the Hacienda of Novelia, about 100 miles from Potosi. A pretty green valley was spread out on the right, and a similar valley to the left, whilst we descended upon the rocky side of the hill as inNo. 36 into the right hand valley facing the southwest, we camped again in front of a Mason, and they were still hostile towards us. At night a cloud dark as Egypt rol'd o'er us from the North West, with a short but heavy shower, accompanied with heavy thunder and lightning. Our baggage escaped by being carried under shelter, and we passed a very uncomfortable night. About eleven at night when darkness reigned in blackness, a noise like stampeeding or stealing  our horses and mules took place. 7 or 8 of our party immediately proceeded to search for the intruders with loaded arms, but found none there except our mule drivers; An hour after some alarm was created by hearing about 40, reports similar to the firing of guns in quick succession over in the next valley; we were however ready for any guerrillas or other intruders, but they did not trouble us further, as we fired salutes a number of times which echoed along the valley like sober precautions. [*Tuesday 27th*] Day clear and warm. Commenced our march at 6. O. clock, and crossed extensive open, dusty, and hot prarie plains. By eight in the morning the Sun generally gets warm and quite hot by nine, which continues until the customary evening breeze springs up from 12 to 5. O. clock.About noon we passed a romantic village where I sketched the church in No 37. but did not think to learn the name of the village as I was much in the rear when I drew it, besides being attacked by a noisy pack of wolfish dogs. To day we began to find plenty of palatable fruit upon the prickley pear plants that were very abundant on our way; which became more ripened as we advanced. We passed around the base of a lofty and barren rocky mountain into a magnificent valley, where could be seen many handsome Haciendos, ranches little lakes walled up, with strong stone breastwork, extensive fields under good cultivation, some of which were irigated by fresh running streams, woodlands, a small meandering river, orange-groves, and other marks of civilization, besides another long and very beautiful village, along a broad and shady road, very unlike what we had seen since leaving San Louis Potosi. It was really an extensive or far reaching valley of civilization handsome ranches, and a garden spot, among the barren praries and mountains of Central Mexico. Rabbits (with long ears and) of uncommon size, were very plentiful, 7 and 8 have been started at a time, of course we made some fine meals from them; A fine fresh breeze blows yet each afternoon from the Gulf of Mexico but in a few more days we are told that it will blow from the Pacific Ocean, towards the east each afternoon at the same time though opposite to that from the Gulf of Mexico. Before Sun set we landed at a rancho called \"San Nicholas\" a dilapidated rancho unlike much of this fine valley which I sketched as in Number 38. here some of our party were in to bathe, though the water was cold, being considerably elevated; water mellons, eggs, &c. were abundant and cheap, and the mellons of excellent quality. Notwithstanding we might here occupy rooms in a  Mason, yet most of our party preferred sleeping out in the open air, although it was somewhat cool at night. At this place there is a small church, which from the peculiarly rude paintings of Deer &c upon it, I would judge to be very ancient among modern things; it has however a flat roof, which is the customary Mexican fashion of building, except where they have become partially Americanized.Wedned. 28th. Day clear and warm. Commenced our march at 6. O. clock for a short days travel of only 15 miles to the beautiful city of San Maria Del Lagos, which is located down the same handsome and fertile valley as before described. Our road was broad, well setled, and abounded with shade, water, and pretty scenery, whilst we were most of the time in full view of the two opposite mountain ranges of barrenness on each side of this pleasant valley of groves and gardens. We entered Lagos city, over a small but handsome stone bridge, by a broad road, quite equal to some of our American McAdamized roads, and of very pretty and romantic scenery. We entered in double file with the pack mules ahead as usual, and presented quite a line of a military face, as each had his coat off, exhibiting uniformly red flannels, and plenty of well kept arms. Multitudes gazed upon us with apparently great surprise and curiosity, to which we have now become accostomed. After winding about for some time along the various streets, &c, we at last came to quarters in the \"Mason De Merce.\" Crowds soon surrounded our wide spreading archway,to sell us mellons, oranges, sweetmeats, etc. &c. In company  with a friend I visited the Market plaza, where I  purchased a fine cantelope for a Quartelia a 3 ct. piece,  a bowl of buttermilk for a Tolacco, 1 1/2 ct. piece. A good  water mellon for a Quartee, 3 cts. a box of excellent  preserves for a Tolacco, 1 cent and a half, and a good  bowl of coffee for a Madeau or 6 1/4 cts. This is the  only place where I ever saw Ice cream for sale. A number of delicious fruits crowded this market, that  we never see in the States, some of which we found  wild along our road. Near the Market there is a  fine large public plaza, well built up with stones  of the first class, with shade trees, many good seats,  and a handsome fountain in the centre. On the North  side of this plaza there stands one among the most  noble and massive Sanctuaries of Mexico, and usually  ranked among her chief churches, which I  endeavored to sketch as in No. 39. it is build of a hard  light red sand stone approaching a cream color; I did  not obtain its dimensions, but it is certainly larger than  any church which I have ever seen in the States, and  in workmanship equal to the finest church of New York.It rises in Lagos like an immense collosal pile, a great monument of perseverance and skill,. It has been erected about 40 years, and towers above the city like St Peters' at Rome. The interior is still more splendid than its exterior, gorgeous displays of wealth, immense gothic works in gold and  silver leaf, are suspended from the far off ceiling, an organ, richly decorated is supported by a beautiful and curiously formed gallery, Pilasters of great height trimmed with silver leaf, rise between and separate very large and brilliant paintings. Statues, here and there decorated with costly dresses, gems, &c occupy their several positions whilst the chief  Altar is a piece of work of great expense and  magnificense, [whilst] and a high arching dome throws its many color'd lights down upon the rich counter colors of the chief Altar, and gives to the whole a peculiarly beautiful appearance. Bells of great magnitude (originally from Spain) toll at various hours of the day in concert with the other church bells of the city. By permission I ascended the only tower in which the great bells are suspended, andfrom that massive stone cupola, I sketched scene No 40.  looking south west over a portion of that fertile  valley before described, and a part of the city of Lagos,  including several fine churches, and the nunnery &c, showing two important table mountains in the distance, the present bed of the river, which is now nearly dry, and the flat rooves of the city; with a small part of the public plaza. This is the most interesting section for a view out of four, as it comprehends only about 1/4th of the city, and time would not permit me to sketch any others in this interesting city. The delay of a half day at Lagos was occasioned by our horses and mules requiring some improvements in shoeing, thus affording me a short period for sketching. This town includes about 12 thousand inhabitants, and is apparently a thrifty and stirring place of considerable neatness and beauty, though in places antiquated. This afternoon at 2.O.clock, a party of 7 Americans and 5 Frenchmen arrived here from Verra Cruz, and the city of Mexico. They met with troubles and dangers by the way, and were very glad to join in with our company in going to Mazatlan, which a part of them did in dangerous times.[*Thorsd 29th*] Day clear and warm. Commenced our march this morning at 6.O.clock, for the beautiful city of \"San Juan Del Lagos,\" a place of about 7 thousand inhabitants, and about 12 leagues distant from the former. More than half the days march was over a dry and barren country. We approached within a very short distance of the town, before discovering it, as it was  situated in a narrow and very deep valley, and hardly discovered until we had got nearly over it, when we descended a paved road directly into the city of life, and dense crowds of curious spectators. The scenery of this deep and narrow valley, with its meandering  water course, and the distant mountains, was peculiarly  barren and wild; but the town had pleasant orange groves, gardens, &c, with shady walks and fountains here and there and a very handsome plaza, upon which  was the largest and finest Sanctuary we had yet seen even surpassing in magnitude the one last seen,  this was indeed a stupendeous pile of human art and perseverance; a sign informed us that its age exceeded 100, years, and it was yet in an excellent state of preservation. In front of this grand Sanctuary therewas a handsome fountain in the centre of a public plaza, surrounded by seats and in a circle of small Allamo trees. Most of the houses were highly ornamented with various colored devices, whilst rows of massive collonades, made the plaza scene quite agreeable, which was very much crowded by the inhabitants, and the market plaza was in its immediate vicinity. No. 41 is a sketch of the grand Sanctuary of \"San Juan Del Lagos.\" in magnitude and external beauty it exceeds the other at San Maria  Del Lagos, but in its interior magnificense it is about the same though still more expansive. The floor of the interior is inlaid with porcelain of China of various colors of chequered work; and the same upon the outer surface of the great dome. The workmanship of the steeples (which are very high) is considered inferior to none in all Mexico, certainly I never before saw any similar work equal to them, either in Mexico, Canada or the States. Time would scarcely permit a careful sketch of this massive edifice, and night closed upon me without my being able to get others from other positions, of fountains, churches, and a view of the city &c. As our party left early next morning no time of course was available for further sketches.[*Fridy. 30th*] Day clear and warm, Commenced our march at half past six O.clock, crossing a large and costly stone bridge, the handsomest and largest I had yet seen in Mexico; it was handsome and built entirely of a light hard free stone; toll was paid in crossing it. a paved road wound around and up the hill in a serpentine form until it reached the summet, from which there was a splendid view of the town, river, churches, groves, &c; we passed from this pleasant view into another very steep, deep, and narrow valley; from which we arose again to follow a rolling barren country of prarie hills, covered here and there with fragments of loose broken rocks, and much broken chalcedony. An Alcalde with Lady, &c. has accompanied our train for several days, keeping near us, and travelling in a regular Mexican carriage drawn by 6 mules, four of which travel abreast, with a driver sitting upon one of them, the whole affair appeared clumsy. He usually stopped at the same Masons with our company; he was evidently travelling under our  protection from Ladrones or robbers, as the Mail and several Mexican gentlemen were then dooing.about 9.O. clock this morning a body of 3 or 4 hundred Mexican soldiers passed us, followed by many women and children, the whole of whoom were on foot except their officers. At the head of one of their companies was an Irish Deserter who addressed us in the usual language of contempt whilst a number of the soldiers spoke to us in Spanish and a little in the English. They were bound for Rio Verdy, a town of importance towards Tampico, in order to put down Queros and his party, who were opposed to the Government of Herrara. During the after part of this day we passed over an extensive country of open rolling and barren praries, exhibiting scarcely any thing else but rocks, gullies, parched grass and in places an abundance of dust. At evening we landed at an old dilapidated rancho, where provisions were scarce and dear; the name of this rancho was \"Lavent,\" which I sketched and No 42, at sunset. [*Sat. 31st*] Day clear and warm. Commenced our march this morning at half past six O. clock, having only 7 leagues for the day For the first time, we now passed through a valley of gentle undulations, having a very red soil, that  was under cultivation, and appearing to be productive, along the valley there was about a half mile to the right,a high hill appearing very much like an old dilapidated pyramid, which was the opinion of several who saw it. During this mornings march, we passed through several small villages of scattering mud cabins, inhabited as usual by Mexican Indians. About 1.O.clock we descended a paved road into a broad ravine, and after crossing a bridge ascended upon the side of a low spreading hill into the town of Tepatillan, where we remained until the following morning as it was too far to the next rancho for the day. Before night [nigh], I sketched the church as in No. 43. the age of which is nearly a century and a half. It is a plain building, very large, and of an Antiquated appearance. This town contains about 6 thousand inhabitants; having a neat and pleasant appearance about the plaza, and chief streets. The walks of the plaza are all followed by ranges of very large and spreading shade trees resembling the Oak though more expansive. In the centre of this plaza there is a handsome fountain, and on the South Side of it, the town market, and opposite under a long colonade where the Alcalde's office was located. A young man from the States, was arrested [here] by some Frenchmen andimprisoned here on a charge of stealing two hundred  dollars, which he protested against strongly. Most of  our company visited him, and by much taking with  the Alcalde had him taken from a miserable cell  of crowded polution, and placed in better quarters,  we could not get him released, and had to leave him  at the mercy of his enraged enemies, and the Alcalde  believing him to be innocent of that charge, although  he frankly acknowledged having stolen 60 dollars  in Mexico, whilst in distress. Upon which acknowledgement  the Alcalde made out his commitment. The  Frenchmen (we were afterward told.) Said they would  wait until the Americans had left, when by some  means they would get him out, and kill him in the  mountains. The whole appeared like a sad affair. I felt sorry for the young man for we could not  render him assistance without endangering our own  liberty. The feelings of the whole American Company  were against the Frenchmen, who treated him with  severe abuse. He was a delicate young man of about 20.  and said that he had left a widow'd mother and a  sister in the States, and he pointed to a ring on hisfinger, and said that this was the only token of theirs now in his possession, and that at night in his cell, the Mexicans had wrench'd his finger repeatedly to get it. If he escapes, it will be by some miracle unknown to wiley Frenchmen, and stupid Mexicans. This evening the host passed around the plaza drawn in his superb carriage, with the usual ceremonies. April Sund 1st Day clear and warm. Commenced our march at an early hour. The first part of the day we passed over a rolling and barren woodless country, with mountains in the distance. In the afternoon we descended into a lower country a large valley extending many miles and somewhat of a triangular  form as in No 44. In this valley a stream meandered along which in places woodlands appeared. At one place on a low and spreading hill, beside this stream, was located a very romantic and beautiful little town, the admiration of all our company. It appeared to be one forest of very tall orange trees, with bushels beside bushels laying thickly strewn upon the ground in almost every direction with small and neat cabins scattered here and there through these extensive groves. Most of the orange trees  were over 20 feet in height, much resembling largeapple orchards. Among the rest of the pleasant things to be observed here, was a cool and refreshing mountain spring of considerable size rushing rapidly in various branches down the quick descents of several of its streets. Shaded by palms, cactus, orange groves and shrubbery, We passed in sight of the plaza; where I saw a neat looking church. About 4 or 5 miles from this village we passed through another, less shaded, beside the same stream, and near a fair looking stone bridge. Still continuing in this long valley, just before sunset, we came to a river of good size, and descending a long slope lined on either side with Mexican cabins, from a  large mason on the hill, down upon a very large and antiquated stone bridge, upon which were four square towers, upon two of which were statues of the King and Queen of Spain, with an inscription beneath nearly obliterated by time, upon the other two towers were statues of monks or fathers. we crossed this large bridge and put up at a mason on the opposite side in the little town of Tolololotlan, after passing up a street of cabins of more than a mile in length, we found our Mason. I then proceeded in company down to thebeautiful banks of the Rio Grande or San Antonio, and sketched  the great bridge as in No 45, looking north from  above on the west bank of this interesting stream. On the opposite or North side of the bridge of  Tolololotlan, the whole river pitches over large  masses of rocky boulders with a heavy lumbering  roar that can be heard for several miles before  reaching it; above it spreads out to a considerable  width dotted here and there promiscuously with  small and interesting islands, with green meadows  rolling hills, and the lofty blue mountains, all of which  forms a highly picturesque scene, which I endeavored  to sketch as in No 46. On first beholding this fine  little river, it may naturally be supposed that we  rejoiced at the first sight of a stream that emptied  into the great Pacific Ocean, and it seem'd to make  us feel that a part of our great journey to California  via Mexico would soon draw the land chapters  to a grateful close. On the following morning by early light  I sketched a part of the interior of our Mason as in sketch 47.  where the earthen flower jars were plentifully ranged  around the tops of our mason columns, containing  shrubs &c.1849. April. At this place we fell in company with a small New York party  of 8 or 10 persons, and learned from them, that one of  their party had been shot in the head by accident and  killed instantly, it happened at a bridge not far from this  place; the father of the deceased was present in the same company. Mond 2nd Day clear and warm. Commenced our march at 6.O.clock for 8 leagues. Passed through a small cove, and then upon a high plane  where there was a considerable pond or small lake, and  afterwards crossed a deep ravine upon a stone bridge by a  small village, a place noted for robberies &c. and from thence  proceeded over a hilly and picturesque prarie country until  we ascended a considerable ridge, in company with a very  large burthen train of miles for the great city just ahead. On descending this slope into a somewhat lower country  a distant view of Gaudalaxhara, broke upon us as in  sketch 47. which I hastily copied by the way, being then  within about 6 miles of the city and looking North west. Before arriving at Gaudalaxhara, at 4 miles distant, we  passed through a small town of a very pleasant appearance  in which there was the remains of a once superb sanctuary. A handsome shaded plaza with a curious fountain,  and a tall and handsome dragon fountain at the North west  suburbs of the town,on this plaza sweet meats, lemonade, and other  mild drinks with Polka, a drink sweeter than cider, with oranges, mellons, bannannas, and other fruits were very abundant and cheap. the exhibition of which presented quite a pretty appearance as they were promiscuously ranged about the fountain plaza beneath the broad spreading shade trees. From the suburbs of this town to the suburbs of Gaudalaxhora, there is a broad Mc Adamized road 3 miles in length, with 4 rows of spreading shade trees, principally of the Allamo with others of very great magnitude, as in sketch  No 48. extending its whole length, thus dividing two pleasant and shady walks on both sides of the principal road, which was about 50 feet in width, about 100 feet including each walk, this road with its neighboring scenery and a distant inkling of the city presented quite a pretty and interesting appearance. We entered the city in double file, with pack mules in the advance. The suburbs appeared very extensive, and it was at least one hour before we reached our Mason, as we seem'dGaudalaxhara. continually winding hither and thither, among a continuous crowd of strange brown faces and peculiar scenes. Having arrived in one of the handsomest and greatest cities of all Mexico, I hastened to avail myself of every opportunity to explore and discover its fine arts &c. In entering we passed 4 or 5 very handsome public edifices but time would not permit me to sketch them except in a  general view. an aqueduct of water, at first mistaken for a regular canal with stone bridges, abutments and its handsomely finished breast works crosses the southern part of the city proper, along it there are shady walks of trees great Magnitude and age, with fountains in shady places,  and fruit plazas in various directions; watermellons were vastly abundant, and cheap, piles of them were seen on almost every little plaza, where any fruit might be sold. As near as I could ascertain the population of Gaudalaxhara, was about One hundred and seventy five thousand which I believe is about the correct estimate, as it appears much larger than Baltimore, M.D. April. Tuesd 3rd Day warm & clear. Our company concluded to remain in this fine city over this day to proceed early on the morrow. Of course I saw and sketched as much as possible. [*31*]The city is very regularly laid out in right angle streets, usually from 20 to 40 feet in width public gardens and several fine plazas, besides market squares variously. It is considered more than twice as large as San Louis Potosi, and the most beautiful of all the cities of this Republic, and second only to the city of Mexico in size. It is located in an interesting valley, and surrounded by barren mountains in the distance, and elevated several thousand feet above the level of the Ocean. A part of the valley about it is under very good cultivation and presents an extensive and civilized appearance. Every thing combined with a pleasant breezy afternoon, such as we had on entering Gaualaxhara, - a prettier scene could scarcely be found in any of the Northern States of Mexico. It is much admired and spoken of by all travelers who have visited it. Its communications with other towns is conducted entirely by mules, and horses, and all goods carried upon the pack saddles of mules. So that the main roads leading each way from the city, is almost constantly crowded for miles beyond the reach of the eye, with thousands of horsemen, and pack mules, going and returning in large companies.Near this city such scenes are really so animating that it would seem almost incredible were the number at one single view given. Dust is of course very plentiful During this day I visited many parts of the city, the interior of several splendid churches, public buildings, gardens, cemetaries &c. The main plaza, is the most splendid of all that I have yet seen in (all of) Mexico, and said to be handsomer than that of the city of Mexico. It is in the form of a square, followed by Allamo shade trees upon each side, with neat seats, and a handsome fountain in the center. The buildings which surround it are of the first class, and bear much resemblance to all the old Spanish edifices of Spain. The streets which Surround it, for nearly a mile in every direction, exhibit great displays of wealth, fashion, business, and refinement. There is a custom much used here, of covering the pavements with long and massive collonades of one and occasionally two stories in height. Almost every house, building, or edifice, excepting the finest sanctuaries, have the usual flat rooves, and generally a very massive appearance, somewhat similar to Egyptian customs. [*52*]Here strange scenes and strange brown faces, that - densely throng the plazas, markets, groves, [and] fountains, and beneath the long and massive colonnades, makes the American feel at once his absence from home, and his isolated position among the most strange of foreign countries. Strange customs, ceremonies, dress, and modes of living seems to transplanted you at once into another and different world. Go where you will, you are a stranger, and a strange object of gaping curiosity, even to the Soldiers in the Official Pallaces, who would treat you respectfully with small presents of fruits, and politeness, and permit you to intrude on forbidden ground, whilst a common mexican for the same intrusion without a permit, might find a sharp whack upon his callabash the consequence. Among the litterati and official circles of this city there is certainly less hostility to the Americans, than among the illitterate, half Indian, and Servile population, and those on the way back to San Louis Potosi. On the main plaza, there stands an immense Sanctuary of great dimensions and magnificense: It occupies asquare of itself including a grand wing called the Cathedral, as in No. 49. The chief building under the larger dome being called the Sagrario, all of which is now being repaired and repainted with superb interior displays. It is the grand Sanctuary of this city and among its finest buildings for interior displays, which are immensely grand and very elegant; gems, Saints in splendid attire, magnificent Altars, Organs, paintings, large immages apparently cast in gold, over the Altars, inlaid porcelain, work, stained glass of various  colors, beautiful silken draperies, massive silver ornaments, gothic columns, and gothic domes gilt with gold and silver leaf, until the whole glittered by the evening lights like some fabulous golden palace for beings above the common things of mortality. No such scenes of granduer can yet be found in the States, and I have been repeatedly surprised at the enormous wealth, which must have been lavished upon these religious pallaces in Mexico. judging from the time, and immense labor required in their completion; and in their superior pieces of Sculpture, Architecture, and paintings, with their mammoth bells, and [*53*]fine toned Organs, superior castings, elegant designs, drapery, massive granduer, orders of Architecture, and fine materials, which at this day, far exceeds the small and half civilized capacities of the original Mexican inhabitants. From Spain all this display of wealth, &c has originated, been cast, planed, carved, painted, and then transplanted upon the planes, vallies, and mountains of Mexico, and there set up profusely all over the land in immense colosal monuments, whilst Mexico was under that Government. From this beautiful plaza I proceeded towards the aquaduct Southward, where getting upon the flat top of a Mexican Mason or public house, I sketched scene No 50. looking North East, towards some of the mountain ranges, and over the prettiest part of Gaudalaxhara, which I selected from the four views, showing a part of the aquaduct a fine large church, a part of the Hospital in the distance and a fine long park. The principal part of the city rises upon a broad and gentle undulation to the left of this aqueduct, the face of which is dotted here and there with handsomepublic edifices as in this view (No. 50). I then  proceeded to a fine public garden about a mile  from this location, in which I took sketch No. 51. I suppose that it covered about 8 acres, being larger  than any of the squares of Philada. In the centre  of it there was a large fountain, from which fine  walks passed off in each direction. Shade trees  of great magnitude covered the square, whilst the beds were full of beautiful shrubs in full  bloom, which on entering presented to us the appearance of a beautiful shady grove richly and  closely carpeted with many species of flowers  so ingeniously interwoven as to show the  figgure of one large flower by the shades of  those planted together. This I have seen  in many places through Mexico. In this garden  there was a fine large revolving swing with 4 seats,  similar to those in the States. This was a large and  very beautiful garden and appeared to be a place of fashionable  resort. From this place I proceeded towards  the aqueduct and sketched a curious fountain in  the long park as in No. 52. From this fountain [*54*]I proceeded about two miles to the northern suburbs,  and passing several beautiful churches of curious  Architecture, I came to a large enclosed Square, which  proved to be a cemetery; apparently of recent origin.  in the center of this square [was] I sketched No 53.  which is a handsomely ornamented and chequered frame with two interior apportuents which were  beautifully ornamented and richly decorated within  No 54 is a sketch of a beautiful freestone monument in the same enclosure. Directly facing No 53, and at  the opposite end of the same pavement I sketched  the grand collonade building as in No 55. each of those  square chambers along it are intended for two or more  coffins, the door of which being closed has upon the outer side the usual inscription of the tombstone. Day light prevented further sketches , though I would have taken many more if the opportunities would have  permitted. The market plazas were located in  several parts of the city, and were crowded to  excess with watermelons and other fruits. and on  one plaza exceeding any thing I had ever seen in  Mexico, and a most beautiful sight too, as everythingwas very tastefully arranged, even to the different colors of Lemonades, &c. Many fruits were abundant here that are never seen in the States.  most of which are sold at reasonable prices. After leaving the cold winter of the States and comming so suddenly into hot weather, dust, mellons, and oceans of fruit amid a Summer heat in Mexico  you may well suppose that we are quite sensible of this change; whilst we often remarked to each other, that our relatives at home little thought that we were now feasting upon the  finest mellons in the world, whilst the cold winds of winter were whistling around their homes. I doo not think that there are more churches here than in San Louis Potosi, notwithstanding this is so much longer than the former city of Potosi. I visited several fine churches, but had no  time to sketch even a small part of the great beauties I saw during even this one day. Though vehicles of any kind were seldom seen through  the country, yet heavy carriages of a clumsey - [*55*]   appearance for the aristocracy and the Priests were quite plentifull in townThe americans still continue to arrive in this city, 40 more during this day from Mexico. Wed 4th. Day clear and warm. Commenced our march at 6.O. clock. On leaving the city, we passed the walls of an extensive prison, which was being erected of stone, at the North Western suburbs. The road was broad, very much crowded, and almost one continued cloud of dust for many miles out of the city. About four miles on the way we passed a neat little village, with a magnificent Sanctuary or public edifice, therein of enormous dimensions and square walls enclosing some 8 or 10 acres, with very high (18 or 20 feet) iron railing in front which was ornamented and gilt, and ranging a full square between delicate pillars and light arches of stone. Some of our party supposed that it was the Bishop's Palace. About 12 miles from the city we passed a tall gate; it was a high stone gate crossing the road in one arch about 35 feet in height with a large Mason, and a few scattering huts about it. After this our road wound aroud large hills, deep ravines, through several narrow passes, and for the first time in a great distance, among numerous large pines, oak bushes, &c ranging over desolate looking hills.At about 20 miles from Gaudalaxhara, I made a hasty sketch  looking west as in No 56. showing the mountains and a small part of the lower valley country, which is somewhat below  the valley of the city we have just left. This is a celebrated  part of the country for Robberies, and we were even told in Gaudlaxhara, that two hundred, Ladrones or  Robbers had left that city the night before us, on our way  to cut us off at about 30 miles out. We did not however regard it, knowing the veracity of Mexican reports  which generally had some other crafty object in view. At about 22. or 23 miles from the city, we came upon an open prarie of rolling or undulating knolls, a part of which had them been recently burned off, on this black charry and dismal looking place, there stood  a large and high gallows, upon which were suspended  the bodies of three Robber chiefs; they had been suspended  there about 3 weeks, and were ghastly looking objects, bullet holes preforated their dried bodies in many  places which were nearly ready to drop to the earth.  over them was a large painted Sign, as follows -  \"Thus the Law punishes the Robber and the Assassin\". Only a few weeks before we arrived here these men [*56*]were chief actors in some bloody deeds, about this place, until some of the government troops overtook them with the justice they merited. The number of these Robbers are said to have been about 200 strong, committing  constant depridations and murders upon travellers and many of the regular Mexican baggage trains. This scene was to melancholy a picture to sketch, so that I left it for a more fit object and about 3. miles further west, as in sketch No 57. I copied a peculiar mountain and small village, to the right of which our road continued its torturous course. In the afternoon as we descended into a third interesting valley, our mountain scenery became extensive, very lofty, and peculiarly wild, moreso than we had yet seen them. Upon the right and upon the left were seen towering mountains, with immense barren cliffs above cliffs, and their numerous rugged woodless spears rising high in the air like collosal ruins of pyramids of yet untold of magnitude. To the west this great triangular valley tapered to our interesting focus, at the far point of which the sun was setting amid a few light and beautiful clouds.whilst the mountains diminished gradually as they receded in the background, all of which formed quite an intersting and beautiful landscape view though very wild. We then descended a hill into the lower valley, and took quarters for the night in a mason, beside the church on the market plaza of the town of Amattitan, being about 40 miles from Gaudalaxhara. Before dark I ascended a high precipice of rocks east of the market plaza, and sketched No 58. showing the square, the big walled spring facing the market, part of the church, part of the town of Amattitan, with its shade trees, with a part of the valley, and the mountains on the western horizon. Here we found plenty of mellons and other fruits all which were quite cheap. Our company here numbered over fifty. A part of them sat by moonlight under the broad archway of the gate of our mason, until 9. O. clock singing in concert, the national songs of America, some 60 or 70 Mexicans, crowded around them seemingly much delighted. About 9.O. clock a Mexican having stolen a purse, from Mr Hassan, was persued and shot at by him, which scattered the rest in short metre.The Alcalde, called next morning and commeded Mr Hassans' course, by saying that he wished Mr H. had killed the thief; it appears that he was wounded, but got off with the bead purse. We were informed at Gaudalaxhara, that this town was, and had been a celebrated rendezvous for the mountain Robbers. &c. [*Thurs'd. 5th*] Day warm and clear. Left Amattitan by early sun rise, and continued our march North west across the valley, among rolling hills of gentle slopes, having small rancho's here and there at short periods; this days road was peculiarly interesting in its scenery we saw to day many fields of the maguay plant ranging over many gentle hills, and upon some of the few fertile spots along the wild mountains base. They make a mild drink from it called  Polka, also the Ardiente, which is stronger than  whiskey, which I believe is made from the magauy also. About 11.O. clock A.M. we passed through Tekelah a town of some importance, noting perhaps 4000 inhabitants. It had a fine shady plaza, upon which stood a very large and antiquated church. On the plaza, fruit appeared in great abundance, andgoing through their usual ceremonies. fruits were abundant and 18, oranges were  bought here for a Madeau or 6 1/4 cts. Orange groves compose the  chief shade of the town. Several very large springs or rather small creeks, breakout of the hills east of the town square, and meander in rapid streams through several of the streets. The water was of a slightly milky cast, and an unpalatable limestone taste. At night the moon rose full and clear, with an occasional flitting cloud, and a gentle breeze. This night a band of 40 Mexicans, all [each] well armed with muskets, pistols, swords, and knives; - presented themselves in double file at the gate of our Mason, or Hotel; and demanded quarters there for the night. Our landlord believing them to be robbers told us to prepare our arms for service, which we did in a few minutes. The Landlord then told them through their captain, that his apartments were all full, and that they could not have quarters in his Mason, to which their captain answered that they would come in in defiance of him and those within. The gate of the Mason which was very broad, and of one expansive arch; the doors of which being open, the Robbers drew themselves up in a compact body immediately before it on the pavement and street. Our landlord stepping forward told them that they must wait a short time until he could see further about his accomodations. But he immediately passed out by another way from his Mason, in pursuit of the Alcalde of the town, who in a short time came with him to our quarters. The Alcalde enquired of their captain who they were, where from be. They answered that they were government soldiers; He then demanded of their captain, their passport as government soldiers, - but they could show none besides the said company acknowledged having travelled on two days, which by the laws of Mexico, no government troops, are permitted to travel. By their dress superabundance of arms, and statements the Alcalde judged them to be a band of ladrones or Robbers, following us, and not improbable that they were a detachment of a larger body, sent in town as government troops, in order to stop overnight in the walls of our Hotel to take us by surpriseand most probably after stealing our arms, then to attack the town, which is a common occurrence in many parts of Mexico. The Alcalde told us that he believed them to be Robbers. He evidently feared them. He told us to see that our arms were all in order and ready for execution in case we were attacked. Its a matter of course all our men were prompt in self defence, and with our guns, pistols, and knives, in hand and about us, we drew up in order, compactly before the door, facing the Robbers, who stood quietly facing and viewing us as mute as a posse of terrified owls; the Alcalde and our landlord refused them admittance into our Mason, but they would have entered by force had not our company presented a bolder front, headed by Capt Grant, of Philadelphia; who told them that they should not enter, except at the peril of their lives, at the same time every trigger was ready to tell. A moment of suspense, and they decamped in quick step up to the town plaxa, where they were permitted to stay by the authorities. After this the Alcalde came several times to ourquarters, telling us to put on extra guards, which we did, even upon the high walls, in order to stand sentinel over our horses as well as our other property, and persons. The Alcalde told us that there was a probability of either our company or the town being attack'd during the night, and wished us to promise that in case the town was attack'd by them, to assist the citizens and his little military force in putting down the Robbers, which we promised, and on the other hand he told us that if the attack should be directed first towards us, his people should assist us, but that we must not mistake and fire upon a religious procession of the citizens which would pass our Mason about 3 O. clock in the morning. This was an evening long to be remembered from many circumstances. It was a most beautiful moonlight night, and now and then a gentle breeze played fitfully from the beautiful lake of Madalena; My turn among the sentinels came from 12 to 2 O clock in the morning; and my positions around the high walls, and the expansive enclosed yards, was pleasant and romantic during so pleasant a night as this; seeming at times like a dream, that I were facing therounds of some ancient castle and looking down among the  dark shades of the groves around slumbering in silence beneath the full and magic moon. I stood upon the house top, meditating upon the beautiful Lake of Madalena, the mountains, standing off in deep shadows, the many flat rooves, the groves and the rocky cliffs near the town; about 2. O. clock a procession of the citizens took place; proceeding from the church and passed our Mason. It was headed by richly robed priests, who were chanting solemn airs; a full sized wax figure of our Savior, of full size, clothed in mourning with a crown of thorns, representing Him as passing up to Mount Calvary, whilst before Him were carried several hundred candles, with several hundred Mexican ladies following each with candles, accompanied with an excellent band of music, the whole was a peculiar scene. Before day light those Ladrones or Robbers before named had all disappeared, having preceeded us on our road through a formidable mountain and vastly grand ravine country, of deep cavernous valleys, suiting such a class of beings.1849 April 6th bay warm and clear. Commenced our march at  half past six o clock, winding our way around that beautiful and interesting lake of Madalena. Formidable mountains appeared in full view and an immense country of sugar loaf hills, sharp peaks, several hundred of which might be seen at one view from elevated positions, at times we passed over a graded road, upon which considerable pains had been taken, about 10 A.M. we descended into a very deep and curious valley of about two miles in width, passing down which it spread out to higher rolling hills with very deep chasms for water passing around these hills and amongst them variously. About 12  meridian I sketched Scene No 63 which was a large Hacienda, westward appeared very large mountains, between which and the Hacienda one several tortuous ravines, the deepest and most awfully grand that I ever saw, being more like immense caverns than ravines. through which we passed about 15 miles. They are called the \"Baranca's\". a road descends upon the  almost perpendicular face of one of them, which is very tortuous and romantic; as you might see the train quite beneath us.winding their way far down the deep cavernous  valley of the Baranca's; as in No 64. with high and  barren Mountains, sparcely timbered towering far above  these numerous deep Barancas. Passing along these  deep narrow vallies, we crossed several times a rapid  creek of some magnitude, over which in many places  high brown rocky cliffs, and various timbers,  bend gracefully over its romatic and noisy waters. No 65. is a sketch passing down the creek in this valley. No 66. do a short distance north west of the former sketch,   with high frowning bluffs of brown rocks. No 67. is another  passing father down the stream, where the road ascends  and again descends to the creek; after fording which  upon rocks [upon] from which the water was bounding  away rapidly; we ascended upon the opposite side,  where a small race of water descended to a pleasant  little dwelling, about which fine timber, several  species of very high cactus, and underbrush with luxuriant  grass were seen forming a highly picturesque  and romantic view. But our train passed so rapidly  that I was much in the rear with my last sketches,  and had to omit this pretty scene for one whichfollowed shortly after as in sketch no 68 where we came to  the junction of apparently three triangular vallies, or deep passes of the Barancas, and the junction of the two fine streams of fair water. At this place there was a pleasant Rancho over the creek, with little groves of oaks, pines, cactus, Bannannas, and beautiful green meadows. Our train turned round and up the left hand valley. And presently  came to scene as in No 69, very high, barren, and steep mountains of almost no timber, arose high in the air, with slight misty clouds around their summets; upon the side of one of them a road was seen ascending which is a view of a part of a graded road, cut over this great mountain by some foreigners at an immense cost, and in most places blown through the solid rock, and of excellent workmanship. In this little valley there was a mill of some kind in operation with a large horizontal wheel. I was afterwards told for the purpose of washing out the silver ore beneath the road, seen on the mountainside, there is a small and pleasant village, in which there is an abundance of fine fruits and surrounded by extensive green fields, meadows, groves, and fine timbers along the stream that meanders through its valley, that spreads  out to a ---triangular cove, dotted with several pleasant Rancho's, No 70. is a sketch taken on entering this pleasant cove where the village was located. After leaving the village we commenced ascending the mountain road. Time would not permit me to sketch as much as I desired, No 71. shows the workmanship on our fine road over, one of the most formidable mountains in Mexico, it is cut out of the rocks, and walled paved and graded thus all the way up this mountain for a distance of six miles. and as great a piece of work of its kind, as any that I know of in the U States of America. No 72. is another sketch farther up this fine road. The view from the Summet of this mountain looking eastward was fine indeed; including many a green and beautiful valley and more mountains, peaks, knolls, hills, vallies, dales, coves, and verdant spots, blended with wildness and prarie hills, than I had ever yet seen in all Mexico; and was really grand beyond description. The mountains far east about Gaudalaxhara could be seen like smoky shadows of deep blue mist. It is said that we have ascended to day, more than  7000 feet, above the deep Barancas through whichwe have just passed; and still a peak arises to our right, around which we wound our tortuous way looking over walls, that looked straight down upon abyss's that were quite beneath us thousands of feet. I found enough here for days of sketching, over which we passed rapidly as it was a region said to be well filled with Robbers, and frequent to many scenes of bloodshed, robbery, and other vile deeds; a few desperate men in these wild mountain passes could doo much harm even to a  large party. On the summit there is a rude breastwork evidently thrown up for that purpose. Cliffs of huge brown rocks here hang over frightful debths and thousands of deep ravines cut deep into and down the rugged mountain. This is our highest elevation  in crossing Mexico, we have gradually ascended 7000 feet to the Barancas, and about 7000 feet again to the summet of this grand dividing ridge of Mexico, making in all an elevation of about 14000 feet above the levil of the Sea. Upon this height we now have the afternoon winds from the Pacific Ocean; and from this forward to the Pacific each day, blowing uniformly from the west, and sometimes very strongly.We now commence our gradual descent toward the Pacific Ocean, an event of some interest to us of course; leaving the scenes east of the great Cordilleres, for those descending gradually into the mild and fertile vallies on the  great western side of this distinguished mountain. No 73. is a sketch of the first scene descending into  a beautiful and fertile valley, along which are plenty of Ranchos, several small villages, several sugar  mills, fine farms, meadows, groves, and plenty of small Mexican dwellings, shaded by Bannanas, Plantains, or perhaps the Allamo, or at times the spreading oak. A pleasant stream of water meandered along this  valley, the margin of which was thickly interwoven with brushwood, wildflowers, and followed by pleasant green meadows, which contrasted in a striking manner with the shadeless, and wild barren mountains; that were broken and rudely tossed into the high air as the fierce storms would toss the waters of the mighty ocean; and as rudely wild, and void of vegetation or timber in many places. This day we have made a march of 54 miles, and arrived at our Mason in the town of [Eastlan ?] a hour after sun set. It appeared to be a fine largetown; at sun set I sketched Eastlan at a distance of a few miles to the  east, being in advance of a part of our train, which during this day got much scattered on the way. There was a fine large Church in this town, with a large shaded plaza or public square, upon which there was a grand display of many  kinds of fruits, drinks &c. including watermellons, Oranges, Bannanas, &c. &c. with Lemonade; Polka, etc. A grand procession of the virgin Mary took place, this evening parading in large crowds the various streets of the town with hundreds of Ladies and Gentlemen each in procession, carrying their separate candles. The immage of the Virgin, was of full size, richly dressed in dark silks, and carried in a handsome Sedan; Other processions took place during  the evening; but I did not see all of them. This is a beautiful town of several thousand inhabitants; the houses are improving, are much neater, larger, and the people becoming much more refined and civilized than many of those before passed; Western Mexico, is well known to be the most refined and civilized portion of that country. We were much pleased with the decided improvement of whitewashing and other displays of taste in this place.No 74. is a hasty sketch of Eastlan and its surrounding mountains. The valley in which it is situated, descends gradually westward towards the Pacific Ocean; and is under good cultivation with pleasant Ranchos', several small villages &c. [*April 7th*] Day warm and clear; with an afternoon breeze from the  Pacific. Commenced our march at sun rise; and proceeded along the meanderings of a pleasant creek; that traversed this interesting valley. A few miles west of Eastlan we passed through a town of considerable size, within which there was a handsome shaded plaza, with a large, curious, and antiquated church. This town was also much shaded by Bannana and Orange groves and a greater part of the houses were very genteel. Here some of our company obtained excellent cups of chocolate &c. Many kinds of fruit were likewise abundant in this place. By the way, as we have before frequently seen, were erected several small shrines of some 8 or 10 feet square, in each of which was suspended the  cross, and around which were wreaths of roses, natural and artificial, with candles partly burned, and other things belonging to their religious ceremonies. These with lone cross's are to be seen plentifully throughoutMexico, and either mark a place of worship, or the spot where some individual has [been] met with an untimely  end. Proceeding down this pleasant valley and winding around various spurs of the wild mountains, that  rear'd their rugged heads upon either side of us, we at 15 miles from Eastlan opened upon a view as in No. 75, with the appearance of a volcano to the right hand. The creek that before travelled rapidly a rocky bed, now joined with other water courses in passing through a ravine or narrow channel of great debth. We now passed over immense fields of wildest volcanic rocks that at some period had been partly fused, and thrown up in rugged masses exceeding any description; extending thus for many miles west and North. The appearance of the rocks was quite black; in places quite spongy, and resembling somewhat the heavy spray of a wild Ocean storm, thrown up in massive peaks, and pinacles, that were at  once suddenly petrified or cooled into black rocky masses of half fused granite &c. Such a field of forrest peaks and black [Schorae ?], I have never before witnessed. The government of Mexico, have cut and paved a road through this lava country at great expense, labor and time.The particulars of which they have taken care to place  upon a pedestial by the way side; whereas by passing the road (such as it was) around a few miles to the left  they might have avoided the worst peaks and ridges  of the [Schorae ?]. Some scrubb oaks high pentangular cactus,  Etc shaded the Lava road in places, until we came out upon  barren hills. No 76 shows a hasty sketch of a part of the  lava fields on our way, looking back Southeast. About  this valley, which have spread out to many miles,  many little Ranchos and villages were to be seen upon  the fertile spots, like favored places upon the  desert of Arabia. The mountains around were exceedingly  wild, and only a few of them even sparsely timbered by a  dwarfish growth, of scrubb oaks, pines, and wild cactus. This broad triangular cove or great valley, was traversed  in every direction by hills, between which were small and  fertile coves, passes, and ravines, along which only the villages  and Ranchos were located. During this afternoon we passed through several pretty villages, that were snugly hid  away in these little vallies, and after passing over   a number of rolling hills, we ascended a mountain  to the north, where we encamped at Rancho Ocott.a few hundred yards from this rancho I sketched scene No 77. looking back Southward upon that great valley of vallies, over which we had just passed; from a height of about two thousand feet. I then passed on up the road 2 miles with a friend, and from a height looking into a vast ravine of perhaps 8 or 10 hundred feet, I sketched scene No 78. looking South west. Showing two great mountains rising in a part of the valley before named; a large stream of water was leaping and bounding off from cliff to cliff down this immense ravine, the sound of which could be heard a considerable distance; whilst it was closely shaded by tall timbers, that rose up the steep sides of the abyss, near to its summet edge. During this day we have seen back in the valley several fine falls of water from 5 to 60 or 70 feet, very suitable for mills but not improved. Along this deep ravine there are fine locations for such purposes. From this place Northward the timber for many miles became very large and plentiful; with large Oaks and pines in particular. During this afternoon Mr Slaight and Mr Jones two of our company were misled upon the wrong track, which caused some fears as to their safety, but both came into camp just  before dark.It is highly important that companies should keep compact whilst crossing the Mountains of Mexico, as those who stray off, are liable to be cut off by those who constantly watch such opportunities in the  trail of the large parties who may cross their country  April 8th  Day warm and clear. During this night individuals well known, left our camp by night, and proceeded forward at full speed, 16 leagues to Tepec, in advance of our train, in order to Secure passage up to california for themselves exclusive of our company should there not be room for all. This was showing their nature horns and all, for which they afterwards doubtless sorely repented, as certain of them had before promised to remain by each other through to California. The remainder of our company proceeded as usual not at all pleased with the rush for passage, almost every Mexican  returning; when asked, gave us different reports about the chances of passenger from San Blass up to San Francisco; and we could ascertain nothing very definite and but little that was encouraging. Some telling us that there was but one vessel in port which could take but four or five more passengers and prices very high, with poor accommodations; others,that there were several vessels in port, and others that there were none that could carry more passengers, and thus the reports varied, but the remainder of us thought best to take things coolly and as they might come; which afterwards proved to be to our especial advantage at Mazatlan. Proceeding northward on the Summet of the mountain on  which we had just encamped, we passed through much large and valuable oak timber. During the morning, I  sketched No 79. which includes Norelio Mountain, as seen  at the distance of about 10 miles to the northward, being also within full view of the town of Tepec to which we were bound. About an hour after sketching the former, we commenced descending a graded road down the mountain,  a part of which I sketched as in No 80. after which we  crossed a fine creek, then passed over and around a number of wild hills with but few scattering habitations, and those of the poorest kind until we came out upon the open woodless hills, that were beautifully rounded and moulded as by art, and only covered by parched prairie grass, and  ranging thus at random around the base of the great Novelio Mountain, whilst sloping off gently in an extensive valley, which was walled in on the North, East, and South by formidable mountains.Again, we ascended a small ridge, which soon gave us a fine view of the great valley of Tepec. We continued descending for Some time upon rolling hills, very sparcely timber with here and there patches of Scrubb oaks, cactus, etc. within about 6 miles of Tepec. I took sketch No. 81. [showing] showing the appearance of the country around that beautiful town. And before entering the town within about a mile and a half I took sketch No 82. showing a fine Stonebridge plastered, and of neat construction; on the principal road to Tepec. This road is generally broad, though not agreeable for [?] vehicles of any kind and is likewise well supplied with fine dust, which during (this) the dry season is almost intolerable during a windy afternoon. Our company arrived in Tepec at 3.O. clock. P.M. a band of dusty travellers, with long beards, jaded, and all the usual et ceteras that attend such a long journey and more especially in Mexico, but not yet closing our journey through this peculiar country. On arriving we ascertained that those preceding us to Tepec had engaged passage up to San Francisco upon a schooner of about 30 tons, that was said to be unfit for service. They paying 70 dollars, and find themselvesbesides being compelled to sleep upon deck; and even at that thinking themselves lucky in getting the chance, at the same time chuckling at us, whoom they considered unfortunate; in not having a chance to sail from San Blass, and at the same time telling us that they pittied us, as we must evidently remain somewheres in Mexico possibly for months to come. But believing that from the greater importance of Mazatlan as a sea port, and place of business, we concluded after resting a day in Tepec to proceed thither, although it was yet another week's journey, the result of which will be seen greatly to our advantage. April 9th  Day warm and clear. In company with a friend (Mr. Sayre), I proceeded this morning at an early hour, several miles out of town upon the summet of a neighboring mountain; (it being a day rest for our animals &c) from the heights of which, an extensive and most beautiful view opened in every direction To the east we saw the lofty peaks of Novelio mountain, and very many of those pretty woodless, and grass covered egg shaped hills before mentioned. Far beyond which formidable mountains reared their misty shadows in dim outline high upon the horizon, upon which the morning's sun had already arissen in his glory amid flitting clouds. The South, thesome great chain of mountains ranged with their many lofty peaks; South west a beautiful valley continued for miles,  with a high mountain ranging west of it. The same mountain  approaching to within a mile of our peak, fell off abruptly  and a valley turned around at right angles with the  former, ranging off into red hills, towards the Pacific Ocean. An extensive and magnificent view broke upon us from  the North, which I endeavored to sketch as in No. 83. North East were seen mountains and peaks piled upon  mountains, many of which were seen far above the mists  and detached clouds of the morning. Here the country  descends rapidly upon the Pacific plains, which are  nearly two days journey from Tepec. The plains could  be seen far on the dim horizon but not the Ocean. This scene was extensive and grand beyond description. To the north and several hundred feet below us, there was  a circular lake of water, No. 84. partly covered with  green rushes, and edged by high walls of rocks, being rugged  bluffs of dark brown rocks, in places covered with a red soil. This lake was nearly round, and elevated several  hundred feet above the valley of Tepec, and exhibited  all the signs of having been at some period a vastcrater to this volcanic country, but now filled up  with water. We then descended into a deep ravine, at the  foot of the hill (letter A) No 84. Through which a fine large stream  water descended rapidly upon a rocky bed. Near the foot  of hill A. is located an extensive cotton factory belonging to Mess  Forbes & Co. as in sketch No 85 .and sketch No 86. taking  two different views of this handsome establishment. The proprietors I believe are Englishmen. Their garden  of Bannanas, Plantains, Oranges and other tropical fruits, is extensive, and exceedingly beautiful, and  more to the idea of some Hindoo scene than one in Mexico. The whole scenery about this factory is  pretty, tasty and romantic. This establishment does  an extensive business. We returned to town by 2.O. clock P.M. after which I sketched the interior of our  Mason (No 87.) or public house, which was tastefull constructed;  our quarters however were not as agreeable as the  appearance of the place. The church on the plaza was large  but of an ordinary appearance, and another similar one  in the town, but a very handsome one of smaller dimensions  1 1/2 miles from the plaza, which time would not  permit me to sketch, and attend to other duties.A hasty sketch of the plaza was also taken as in No 88. It was surrounded by large shade trees of the oak; and in the centre of it there was a pretty fountain of a plain but neat appearance. The plaza was almost entirely surrounded by colonade rows of usually two Story Stores of the first class. The streets of the town ran uniformly at right angles; were clean, and well paved; the same at Gaudalaxhara, the towns of Logos, and San Louis Potosi, etc. The rooves of the houses were uniformly flat, generally one story in height, frequently whitewashed, or neatly ornamented with various colors. But the suburbs of the town, as usual for Mexico, was surrounded by small mud cabins which so much destroys the good effects of Scenery about the Mexican towns, villages, Rancho's etc. At Tepec, we met another American party, and here also 10 of our company left us in order to proceed a distance of 60 miles to San Blass, and from thence embark upon a vessel they had never seen, which afterwards proved to be unseaworthy and landed them some 9 or 10 days afterwards at Mazatlan in (distress and other) difficultiesWe had remonstrated with them however at Tepec, and there they considered their chances much superior to ours. [*April 10th*]  Day warm and clear. Left Tepec at an early hour, and proceeded through a northwest pass, among red hills, little coves, and small narrow and fertile vallies among Shady groves, palms, Bannanas, Plantains, Oranges, &c. and when plenty of watermellons could be  obtained very cheap with other fruits, this region of the country appeared well setled with neat and Shady Ranches, and well supplied with running streams of water. Many farms here appeared like little paradis's for shade romance, and the comforts of life; and many were the  varied scenes of this [day] morning that were really captivating. [except] But in the after part of the day upon the planes, having descended upon a warmer country, we were  open more to the sun, and much annoyed by dust. In making our grand descent upon the plains, we passed down over a long rotine of rugged hills, that gradually diminished as we descended, being sparcely covered with large Palm trees, some underbrush, and now and then parched, prarie grass not of much interest. The view however on descending was extensive, as in sketch No 89.Having descended upon the Pacific Plains, we were  again in a much warmer climate. We again passed from the dull monotony of timbers upon the mountains when such may be found, to a lower country where a large variety were daily presented to our notice. We now saw Palms in great abundance, large oaks, the Banyan, Beach, some cedar, large cotton bearing trees, tropical fruit trees plentifully, with many whose species were unknown to us. We passed several small villages on the planes, and a number of Ranchos. Enormous trees of a species with which I am not familiar, but resembling the mulberry somewhat in shape  and leaf, and in other respects the Beach tree, grows by the road side in many places, and being dense for spreading and of very great magnitude, it frequently gave us an acceptable shade; during our travels across the planes. These five large shade trees, are however not too abundant, and by seeing them in the distance I frequently judged our distance from a Rancho; as they are favorite trees on these planes. This afternoon we crossed two almost dry beds of wheat when flush were called rivers, but not of great magnitudeOn this days route fruits, Mellons, etc, were plentiful and cheap. 16 Bannanas for 6 1/4 cts or a Madeau, A fair water mellon for a Madeau (6 1/4 cts) 1 madeau for a dish of beans stew'd with some meat. 1 madeau for 3 boiled eggs, and 1 madeau for 4 or 6 tortelias or corn cakes; As we had found it on the other side of the Cordilleres, we also experienced here; high prices in Scarce and barren places, and cheap things where the soil was good, well settled, and fruit groves, etc, consequently to be found. About 3 O. clock P.M. our train halted for the night at a Rancho 33 miles N west of Tepec which I sketched as in No 90. The water of a neighboring creek being warm, a part of our company were in to bathe. During this night Mr Davis (who joined us some days back) was scalded by the accidental overturning of our large camp kettle, in which was stewing a fine mess of chicken, supposed to have been done by wolves, that were heard about just before I was on duty as one of the Sentinels from 12 to 2 and several times, heard the wolves, Mr D was not badly scalded however. [*April 11th*]  Day clear and hot. Commenced our march at an early hour, and soon forded a broad and very rocky creek, and during the morning passed through several acceptable woodland groves.Passed a number of ranchos where fruits &c. were plenty and cheap; and the country now generally quite levil. About noon, we came upon the broad sandy beach of a river. Our saddles, baggage, &c. was conveyed across in small boats, (canoes) whilst the whole drove of our animals swam the river together. The scene was  interesting and having a few moments (after just finishing a fine large water mellon) I sat down and  sketched the river, Mountains, &c., as in View No 91. The mountains were still in view; and follow upon our right, all the way to Mazatlan, as we are now persuing our way up the coast, though not yet in Sight of the Pacific Ocean. This river which we have just now crossed (I was told) is called the \"Rio San Diago\", being about 18 Mexican leagues from Tepec, or something over 50 miles. Having crossed the River, whilst the mules was reloading &c. for our further progress, most of our company went into a town nearby (of some size) and refreshed themselves upon fruits, coffee, chocolate, eggs, &c. etc. The town though of good size, was dilapidated and of an ordinary appearance, though commanding apretty location. Persuing our course over a very dusty road that wound hither and thither upon a levil country of brushwood and larger clusters of timber, we passed through a village of perhaps 40 or more houses, all entirely deserted, except one, which was tennanted by one Solitary man of a fierce countenance, being a cripple, who had only a few poor mellons for sale at high rates. This was rather strange yet strangely true, one man the Sole lord of a desolate village, no other Mexican was seen in the whole place, and all was closed up without Signs of furniture; the place may have fell into the hands of Robbers, or be unhealthy; we did not ask respecting it of the man, although it excited remarks in our company. This afternoon afforded but little of interest except some large cotton fields, with ripe cotton, belonging to some Ranchos, and surrounded by fences, which is an uncommon thing in this country, fences are very  rare throughout all Mexico. we travelled many hundred miles without even seeing a fence; although there may be many farms, it is not every man that has a fence, and even those who posess them mostly have very short appologies for fences, which  are rare things in Mexico,I mean fences of wood stone fences of great length, have been seen almost every day or two, amongst the settled parts of the mountains. To day we saw, as beforementioned, fine fields of cotton; but for the first time that I remember in Mexico. We also saw a wild tree about the size and shape of an ordinary apple tree, bearing large and numerous pods of the fine white cotton; And a number of curious fruit trees about the woodlands and water courses. Much of this days travels, all things considered is not by any means inviting to travellers; being dusty in places open to the hot sun, and much of the time rather uncivilized in appearance, which however is no criterion to judge western Mexico by. Before sunset we halted, after a long days march at the Rancho of \"Buena Vista\" being about 145 miles from Mazatlan. I sketched this place as in No 92. A friend Mr Custer, and I went out afar the creak near by for game, and we returned in about 15 minutes with 3 large Pheasants upon which we made a fine supper, and obtained plenty more for our breakfast, and to carry with us for our dinner, our company numbering at this time between 25 and 30. Since leaving Tepec, those for San Blass taking  another road.[*April Thorsd 12th*] Left our Rancho at an early hour. Day clear and hot; with the usual afternoon winds from the Pacific. Passed over an extensive palm country this day, gentle slopes all day covered sparcely with tall and scattered Palm trees, grass burnt off for miles in places; much wild game by the way, few habitations, and those generally of the lowest class. In the morning sketched No 93. of the lofty peaks &c. of the  Cordilleres on our night, which are always in full view in passing up the coast . About noon we again came  to the bank of another River which was partly dry, and at this season fordable, I did not ask its name, but the town of Cauponetta , was on the opposite side to which we forded. A number of Mexican women were along the margin of this river at their customary employment of  washing out clothing; one very clear trait of the Mexicans. Sketch No 94. shows, the river, town, and mountain scenery from opposite Cauponette Puebla. After refreshing  ourselves upon mellons, fruit, etc, in this pleasant town we proceeded forward at a rapid gait to finish a long days march. Much of our road was very dusty, though there was less wind than usual; our country slightly rolling and upon the night a full view of the lofty mountains of the coast.This night we encamped at a desolate Rancho a few miles beyond a river, where things had a distressing appearance we could neither obtain water or food of any importance at this place, so that most of us had neither supper nor breakfast. The appearance of everything about these few huts, was perfectly squallid, and the natives almost totally unclothed and appearing reckless and unconcerned about any thing. We camped beside the road, and huts, and kept strict watch during the night; but a few miles back, on the other side of the river we could have encamped at a small village, where all the conveniences were at hand, but being only a few days from Mazatlan, our company became very anxious to finish their land travels in Mexico, and consequently pressed each day. We missed it, decidedly in crossing the river this night, as we left a pleasant camp grove and conveniences at that place, for a desolate place where we lost two meals, and had no water either for our animals or ourselves  April 13th  Day warm and clear with a fine seabreeze this afternoon Passed through a nearly level country, covered with scattering palms; we came to a village of a squallid appearance about 10. O.clock A.M. where by much trouble we made out to get something to  eat.of all squallid places we had yet seen, this village was the climax. Here in front of a cabin, sat a wretched looking woman clothed in rags, and her feet projecting on the walk from a heavy pair of wooden stocks, where she was fastened probably for some offence. The whole of the inhabitants were almost entirely unclothed and appeared to be living in misery and starvation. Having the bold mountains on our right which were all day in full view, we proceeded onward up the coast through Palm forrests, that seem'd never ending, and towards noon oppressively hot; several crosses were passed this day; whilst this section of the country appeared very much uncivilized; and we frequently met men, entirely without clothing. A range of mountains seem'd now to range off west to the Pacific Ocean, over which it appeared that we must pass, on the morrow; approaching within a few miles of their wild and rugged base, we encamped at a Rancho called Cerauso, as in Sketch No 95. here things appeared more genteel than on the previous night and we were enabled to purchase a scanty allowance of provisions, which were in demand and highly acceptable.April 14th Day clear and hot, Left our rancho at an early hour, and proceeded along the base of rugged mountains directly west to within some 5 or 6 miles of the Pacific beach, but not in sight of the ocean, as we came upon a low ground, we passed around the end of those mountains, and travelled over flat planes covered with high grass, and in places pools of Salt water, and yet on this day we did not see the ocean, although at one time we were said to be quite near to the beach. from the edge of a Small Salt lake, I sketched some large and high rocks, which were the terminus of the mountains and nearest to the ocean as in No. 96. I had no time to ascend it, or I may have possibly first beheld the Pacific from its Summet. Again we appeared to direct our course inward from the coast, which brought us in the afternoon to a broad river, with wide beaches of sand and gravel. This stream we forded and entered the pleasant town of Rosario as in sketch No. 97. The location of this town with its mountain scenery was very pretty and interesting. Fruits of every kind with fine mellons were very abundant and cheap in this place. The churchwas large, antiquated, but of handsome finish; up the river about two miles and upon the opposite side, there appeared in full view a similar building of great magnitude, and from its colors and peculiar structure appearing to be much superior to the building in Rosario. Mountains of great magnitude were from 5 to 10 miles to the eastward. In the afternoon we left this pleasant and populous town, and persuing our way among gently rolling hills Palm groves, and vast tracts of brushy oaks, Bodock trees & we encamped at a village of a genteel but  odd appearance; where provisions were plenty, and cheap, and the inhabitants quite friendly. Oranges, mellons &c plentiful. April. 15th  Day clear and hot, persued our course at an early hour, travelling the same routine of plains, rolling grounds, gullies, Palm forrests, &c this day we passed through many miles of Bodock trees, which much resembled an orchard of civilization, extending, far beyond the reach of the eye, with many thousands of bushels of large Bodock apples; I have no doubt but that in time, the seed of these trees will be sought after  for making hedge fences over countries where timber may be scarce. At noon we passed through a fine large townand stopped for a time to refresh ourselves at the market plazas; immense quantities of watermellons were seen in every direction; Soon a large congregation of Ladies, Gentlemen, and civilized looking people came pouring forth from a  large and antiquated church upon the plaza; and people quietly on their way to their houses, though viewing our company with some little surprise and attention. From this town we persued our way over \"slightly rolling\" country of Palms, oaks, and in places a variety of timbers and encamped at night as usual at a rancho. April. 16th Day clear and hot. Persued our journey at an early hour being in full view of Mountains all day, sometimes among hills, and at others upon plains of Palms or extensive groupes of underbrush, with scattering trees of magnitude. The mountain Scene No 98. was sketched this afternoon, from the summet of a Small hill. during the day we passed over several open praries and at night encamped at a rancho of a respectabe appearance beside a fine stream of good water. April 17th Day clear and hot. Persued our journey at Sunrise in order to reach Mazatlan this day. During themorning our road wound considerably amongst small hills, and was sparcely timbered with some Palms, Oaks, &c during the whole day, except where Salt lakes had left level planes of Sand, with not even vegetation Sometimes for miles in some directions upon one of these sand beds, I witnessed to day, what is called mirage, or the deception of water, ahead. For some time I supposed that we were coming to the margin of a lake whose waters were troubled into waves by wind, but on approaching the same, I discovered the mistake; by discovering that the heat of the Sun caused a mist to arise from the sand, which by its position and  reflection to the eye caused the deception called mirage. about noon we arrived in the old village of Mazatlan distant from the present Sea port of Mazatlan, about 24  miles. At present it is a place no importance, and is much dilapidated; we obtained some fruit here and proceeded on our journey to the port of Mazatlan, before leaving this place I sketched the ruins of an ancient church at one corner of the old village Square as in Sketch No 99. Shortly after leaving this place we forded a river, and persued our course over a level ground towards the Pacific OceanSketch No 100. was taken 15 miles from the Port of Mazatlan. Those hills on its back ground are along the Pacific, and several of them stand out in the Ocean. The foreground is a Sandy plain, on which at w, I thought I saw the lake of water, which as I was very thirsty at the time, appeared quite acceptable, and after taking the sketch, I dashed away full speed with my horse, to reach it with the company, but it proved to be a very complete deception of water. Approaching within 8 miles of the Pacific, we came to the bank of a Salt lake, which I sketched as in No 101. showing the distant hills near the port of Mazatlan. At 6 miles I took another sketch as in No 102. whilst we were passing around the Salt lake. The fresh breeze was fanning us from the pacific; the declining Sun was shedding his gentler evening rays upon us from over the hills of the Port of Mazatlan, as we wound our way around that pretty lake before named, and crossing the flats, we arising suddenly upon a high ground came at once in full view of the long sought for port of Mazatlan, and for the first time a broad and beautiful view of the Pacific Ocean, its islands, shipping, and its foaming  surfs that chased each other rapidly upon the pretty beach before us. What a captivating view; two great objects at one view, the Pacific, and the port of Mazatlan  with also the gratification of now closing our land,  journey across Mexico, and again embarking upon the  mighty waters of the Ocean; and thus ending the second great chapter after leaving Philadelphia, and about to  enter now upon a third important change. All  the past toils were passed over without a murmur, when arriving here, none would of course return by the same way should such ever offer, but none were sorry that they had encountered the toils and fatigues of this journey when they knew it had now closed by land, and was about to commence by Sea; and all were of course well pleased and quite merry on entering the town with their prospects of soon being at Sea; and done with Mexico."

    "paragraph": "Having been some time impressed with the belief that a trip to California would be beneficial not only in a pecuniary point of view, but likewise to the better regulation of health and future happenings, I resolved about the 1st of January of 1849 to have my profession that of a Mathematical Instrument Maker and the eve to be remembered Monumental city of Baltimore for a trip to the golden shores of the far western El Dorado. Circumstances favoring, I made preparations in Philadelphia presuming that my trip thither would be made by sea around Cape Horn a distance of 7000 miles in the Ship \"Mason\" which advertised to leave that port several times fixing definite days of departure. Mr W.H. Ogden called upon me requesting my naming in forming a company then to be limited to 10 or 15 select gentlemen. I consented and gave my name as one of the party them numbering three, whose names were W. H. Ogden, B Jay Antrim and W Middleton, the latter of whom had since resigned and remained at his residence in New Jersey. Mr Ogden and myself drew up a notice at Mr Bonsals' Book Store, at No 33 1/2 Market Street, Philadelphia and inserted the same in the \"Ledger,\" and \"North American.\" The advertisment requesting all desirous of making a speedy and an agreeable journey via Matamoras, Monterey, Saltileo, Durango and Mazatlan to California to address \"Camargo,\" at the office's of those two respective papers, which was soon followed by a number of applicants; who were severally visited by Mr Ogden and myself. Mr Jones, of 6th Street, being the first of that number added to our list. We soon procured a room for meeting at No 100 Chestnut Street through the kindness Majors Collins and Ross, where we met in harmony and concert of action until we had completed our company and extended the number of the same to Forty. At one of the Meetings, the name of \"Camargo Company\" was adopted, which is the name of a Mexican town, to which we were first destined from Philadelphia, by sea, and from thence after having procured there our outfit of mules provissions & to proceed overland to Mazatlan via the abovementioned route. Old resolutions adopted in our \"Camargo\" meetings limiting our numbers were several times rescinded and new ones were adopted until our number had increased to forty as before mentioned & Committees of Camp Equipage, provissions, pasports, protections, for chartering a vessel &c all of whoom acted and reported accordingly. Having ascertained that the abovenamed route was infested with hoards of warlike and savage Camanchee Indians, who were committing outrages and massacring those found in their way, and that the same route was in consequence very dangerous, and believing it rash, as also influenced by friends, I withdrew my name from that route, and proposed the Tampico route to the company as the safest, most pleasant, and a shorter land distance than the former; which then being unfavorably received, I withdrew by advice, and my own impressions of that course, and then prepared to proceed around by Cape Horn. In the mien time, the company adopted the Tampico route via San Louis Potosi &c. and —Mr. Ogden called upon me to inform me of it and his desire with many of my old friends was that I should return to the company: and as they had changed the rout to the one I thought most prefferable, I again added my name. Mr Ogden was elected President and myself Secretary of the \"Camargo Company,\" and in my leaving Mr W Robinson, merchant, was elected to supply my place, in which by request and his absence I served several times after my return. A committee appointed chartered the Brig \"Thomas Walters,\" to convey our company of forty to Tampico in Mexico, which was contracted for at $50.00 each, for cabin passage, and the vessel advertised to sail at 8 O Clock A.M. on the 31st of January 1849. Four members declined going with us and three others filled their vacancies. In consequence of some difficulty in entering our articles at the custom house for Mexico, whereby our Captain and vessel was in danger of the laws of Mexico, - our departure was delayed until 9.0.clock A.M. on the following morning the 1st of February. Feb 1st Slight Snow, cold and finally sleety rain; I repaired with all remains of baggage to the vessel at an early hour, and found many congregated to witness our departure. The crowds along the wharves notwithstanding the inclemency of the weather, continued to increase until many hundreds lined the surrounding piers. A few minutes before 9.0.clock our company repaired with arms to two lines upon the Quarter Deck, and fired from guns and pistols a departing salute. Mr Robinson then presented - \"three cheers to our Country\", which our company responded to with warmth - \"three cheers to the friends and dear bonnie lassies, we leave behind,\" and it burst simultaneously from the very hearts of all. - and \"three cheers to Philadelphia\" which we answered appropriately according with our sentiments of the Quaker City. The citizens upon the wharves responded - \"three cheers for the success of the Carmago Company\" followed by a succession of cheers for individuals named in our company, among which the clerk of the Ship \"Mason,\" observing my singular dress in common with my comrades and knowing me, gave \"three cheers for the Buckskin Injnn.\" and thus did our friends cheer us at the hour of separating from all that was dear to us, to embark upon the great and eventful Ocean of future prospects. About, 9.0.clock A.M. the steamboat \"Wave' came beside and before night towed us in co with another vessel as far as New Castle. At New Castle we dropped anchor for the night, and finding a mistake of six packages of provisions which were nescessary for the completion of the captains' manifest for Mexico, it was found requisite to send Mr Thompson, immediately back to Philadelphia in order to bring on the same by express, which he did by an early hour on the following morning, and received a vote of thanks from the company. This evening was spent with considerable spirit and mirth on the part of Messrs Robinson, C. Jones and Bates; which however was excused by the company in general as they were known to be gentleman, and believed to be unaccustomed to such heavy exercises. Besides the leaving of home under the deepest immaginable of melancholly feelings. This day a vote was taken in the affirmative for prohibiting the smoking of cigars in either cabin of the Brig, the quantity of powder and combustibles on board beeing deem'd a sufficient reason. The Roll was called and the following gentlemen answered to their names, --  to wit. Some of our company went on shore at New Castle and made some few purchases of small articles. Have up anchor at an early hour, and got under way towards the breakwater. weather cold and hazy. Proceeded but a short distance this day and cast anchor 2 miles below Reedy Island, in the afternoon where we remained until 4.0.clock the next morning. Weather clear and cold with a North West wind which drove us out the bay in a beautiful and interesting manner with full canvass on a bounding sea. Personal feelings were consulted over the guard in a member of cases, and after, relief expressed. My feelings were much agitated in consequence of the heavy ocean [swells], and I left an elegant dinner of soup and chickens to contemplate the foamingbillows, and returned when convenient to finish the same, which I did in a few minutes with more relish after having cast over a full account much to the relief of my inexpressible feelings. The dinner table was left patronized by our gents than on the day previous, who were also contemplating the foaming billows with the same inexpressible feelings. One instance of inebriation occurred this day which created unpleasant feelings between the captain and said individual, but was amicably settled to the benefit of said person and any of the company, should they in future indulge, which it is presumed they will not doo, as many if not nearly the whole of them, appear to be temperate and sensible men. This evening being much moderated, with a clear and beautiful Moon, most of our party promenade the whole round of the vessel in rapid Military order, whilst the brig bounded upon the long and high Ocean Swells with that majesty becomming the bread bosom of the Atlantic; whilst the spray threw up to the bowsprit and the sheeted sides, it's showery foam, gilded by the silvery rags of the Moon, and followed in the wake  by a long bright trail of foaming ripples receding in our pathway back to the horizon.Our boat dashed on handsomely to the tune of a brisk wind, whilst the music and merry songs of the happier ones arose in concert with the gently whistling winds that playfully tuned their ocean song amid our rigging and canvass. The whole scene was exceedingly  interesting, and the music harmonious,  being sung by good voices, well timed, and filled with the deepest base voice, for a human being that I ever heard, which added greatly to the sweetness of the music; they sang numerous songs that had more richness amid a scene like this, than I had ever before supposed could be the case; I enjoyed it very much. Harmony and quietness prevail generally throughout the cabins, and no discords have occurred this day. A clear, mild, and beautiful morning. I rose early in order to behold the Sun rise over the ocean, which was beautifully decorated  with long light clouds, which partly shaded its disk and gave more glowing colors to the scene; At 10. A.M. a meeting for worship,was called on the after dark, and Revd Mr. Woods,  officiated, assisted by the Revd Mr Blake, nearly each  member attend the meeting; which was conducted  with very creditible solemnity and attention. The  subject was to those who go down upon the great  deep, with a copy of an address delivered by a Revd  gentleman to the young gentleman of Boston, on emigrating  to California, and the choice of good society. A pistol exploded from firing last night, and Mr. Robinson  was cut back of the right shoulder by a piece  at least 5 inches in length, the would though sore  to stay is not however dangerous. This afternoon  many guns and pistols were fired at the little  dog sharks, that are now following our vessel in  numbers; 7 or 8 of which were caught and hauled  on board with fish hooks and lines; they were  usually two feet in length, and bore some resemblance  to the common pike. This afternoon we have  made but little progress, owing to a calm, and  have hardly average 2 knots an hour for half the day,  Towards night clouds arose with sprinkling rain  and there was a general disposition to be in doors. Monday 5th - Up before sunrise and saw the sparkling ocean spray as our galliant boat drove swiftly o'er mountain waves before a fierce gale which changed to a storm by noon, a day long to be remembered by many of our sea sick company. Such a sight all over the Brig, it only kneeds  an old sea faring man to judge of over 30 green ones just ushered to sea in a fierce gale with rain pelting them like so much fine shot; and they bounding sky high on mountain billows. The bounding of our vessel was truly majestic and far beyond what I had ever before witnessed; all sails were tied up and nothing but the small stay sail open to the gale during the afternoon Nearly the whole company were sick, including myself, but I did not so much as loose one meal by it. I soon had an apetite, which was also  the case with many others; few however were at dinner this day. Upon the whole it was a day of miserable sickening, storm, gales and long billows many of which were full 25 feet in perpendicular height.clouds, rain, howling winds and high sea raged all day Tues 6th Beautiful clear morning, after a terrible night of high winds and high billows. To day the ocean moved in immense swells like small hills, with yawning vallies between, but the morning was clear, and the air mild and further fire unescessary. Our stove being upset this morning we did not rectify it, nor feel the need of it. The sick ones are improving and getting lively; the vessel has bounded on beautifully all day, and we crossed the Gulf Stream this morning, winds from the west which drove us out to sea, possibly 350 miles from land, and this evening a little south of the lattitude of Charleston of South Carolina. Saw one sail to the west this morning. Light clouds in the afternoon, and pleasant moonlight evening, with the sea and winds pretty high. Company merry on deck, & Saw one porpose, 5 or 6 nautilus, and gulf weed this morning all interesting to one looking for a subject. It should have been mentioned that Mr. Hewes, one of our company, lost his belt overboard yesterday containing two hundred and twenty five dollars in gold.Wednesday 7th A cloudy morning, high winds and mountain billows; air cool and winds mostly from the west. We bounded on bravely all this day o'er the foaming sea, realing too and fro, with our deck at times almost at an angle of 45, both side ways and lengthwise. The dishes on the dinner table partook likewise of the general commotion. This whole day was another of swift winds, amounting almost to a gale, which stirred up the billious temperaments of our company as usual, and there were many sick ones about deck again as usual. At 12, at noon, we passed a sail in the distance and at 1.0.clock P.M. another to which we hoisted a red flag with red star upon a square white ground, which they answered with the American flag; the winds and the ocean being  to high to speak them. They were bound to the States. We passed them in about Latitude 32 and about 400 miles out to sea from South Carolina. At night the moon rose amid flying clouds, but the air was so cool, the wind so high, and our deck so much wet by the spray from theangry mountaneous ocean, that few remained on deck long; the berths being prefferable. It is not an uncommon thing to hear one or two fall out of their berths, upon the floor, and to observe a general scrambling of boots, hats, trunks, &c for a downhill race to the opposite sides of the cabin whilst cradling upon the high blue  ribs of the ocean. Then occasionally springing a breeze. Thursd 8th Light clouds, air mild, and a pleasant breeze from the North East, with light ocean waves. Held a meeting on financial arrangements on the Quarterdeck at 10.A.M. Saw a ship ahead this morning bound southward in Latitude 29° 40,\" about 400 miles out to sea. Fine sunny day with bland breezes and very light ocean swells. Nearly all of our company are amusing themselves about decks variously. Catching sea weeds, and fifty other little time killing amusements. At 4 O.clock P.M. we held a meeting on the Quarterdeck during which time we elected Mr. Grant, our Captain, for the trip over Mexico to Mazatlan. Mr. McCrellish, 1st Lieutenant, Mr. Hughes, 2nd do Mr. W. H. Ogden the Quarter Master, and Mr. Thompson, the Commissary. It being understood that we go through during our voyage, a regular Military drilling in order to fit us for cases of insurgency in our Mexican Campaign. A pleasant moonlight evening, air mild, with a brisk breeze, and sailing about 10 Knots the hour. Friday 9th A beautiful morning of pleasant breezes; up early and saw the sun rise clear upon the rolling ocean. We sailed beautifully all day with a fine breeze. Things passed off pleasantly and merrily all day, with a mild and elegant moonlight evening; set up until 11.O.clock, hearing and telling wonderful things, which were magic charms, when told by moonlight on so mild and exquisite evening as this, added the gentle undulations of the sea, the fountains of spray, and the bland Zephyrs of the South. Saw a number of white flying fish during this afternoon, which were beautiful and attractive. Sat 10th A clear, warm, and calm morning, sun even getting hot Near, but not in sight of the West Indies. No wind and almost quiet; Ocean almost quiet; This day proved to be a regular calm, and the sun very warm. Coats and vests off, and hardly a breeze. We do not appear to have moved 15 miles all day. A breeze sprung up in the evening and got us under headway at about 5 knots, with a pleasant late moonlight night. A flying fish came on board this evening and was captured. All are well so far on the vessel. Sund 11th Morning warm, clear, and a brisk wind driving us at the rate of 10 knots towards the island with the \"hole in the wall\", but not in sight yet (11 A.M.) Came in sight of the Bahamia island at 1/2 past 11. A.M. but there being a high head wind, we lost all this afternoon and night in tacking too and from the land, with a high sea. Held a meeting  for worship this afternoon at 1/2 past 3.O.clock. Rev'd Mr. Woods delivered a powerful and highly eloquent appeal to our company, with a good effect. A request was sent to our Chaplain (elect) by several individuals, to their discredit, not to hold services on board; but it being overruled by a large majority, services were held as usual. Monday 12th Mild with high head winds, only about 10 miles gained by tacking the whole day. We were insight of the islands several times during the day. At night a black and angry storm rolled over us with rain and fierce winds raising huge billows, howling and tossing us fearfully about on the ocean all night. Silent fear reign'd in our company, but some hardened cases went so far as to make sport in the midst of this exciting scene. Tuesday 13th Passed the \"hole in the wall,\" with light house early this morning. The sun rose beautifully in a fleecy cloud of golden hue, and a brisk wind drove us rapidly towards the Bahamia Bar, the day is clear, mild, and our Brig passed 5 other vessels this morning all bound in the same direction. Arrived at the Bahamia Bar, at 12 Meridian, and crossed it during the afternoon and evening; The water on the Bar is from 15 to 40 feet generally, and sufficiently clear in most places to see bottom at 15 feet. The bottom appears to be composed of white sand, with here and there patches of sponge. The color of the water on the Bar for about 60  miles is a beautiful light Skye Blue, whilst that of the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico is of a darkand blue color. we passed Berry islands this morning and saw there, a number of small sailing craft, and some about a wrecked vessel. A colored gentleman has a very fine farm, and several wives upon one of these singular looking islands. A good breeze drove us on rapidly ahead of all other vessels. The day has been warm clear, and the sun set among gilded clouds showing us a scene exciting universal admiration. Such a glowing sun set scene, few of us have ever before witnessed even in midsummer. There is something exquisite, glowing, brilliant and more diversified with brilliant and unapproachable colors accompanying a sun set scene in this southern chime, that seldom occurs to those farther north, and infinitely above the Artists pencil. [*Wednesday 14th *] Temperature mild, high and favorable wind driving us rapidly to the South west over the gulf of Mexico. No land in sight this morning. Saw several hundred flying fish this afternoon; the vessel appeared to scare them out of the water. We travelled very rapidly all this day and night.[*Thursd 15th*] Morning clear and mild, with a strong breeze driving us rapidly ahead, no land in sight. The gulf is here of a bluish brown appearance and occasionally when the sun is in a certain position of a greenish cast. Our vessel is now dashing off spray and waves of white foam as though she were ploughing by steam. One of our company Mr Chevallier, fell  down our cabin stairs this morning, but was not seriously injured, though stunned by the (long) fall. [*Frid 16th*] Morning clear, warm, and a regular calm. We were lying still at sun rise, but a breeze sprung up during the morning which increased to a strong wind during the afternoon, and drove us forward quite rapidly. This day was warm and clear. Saw many flying fish as usual with some Nautilus, & the Gulf waters appear now nearly black. The spray is flying skye high o'er deck, and we are dashing onward within about 550 miles of Tampico. Cool, high head wind, rough sea and day generally  cloudy, a day of but little interest. Cool, wind from the North, a strong gale with some rain, sea very high and disagreeable. Saw large schools of Porpoises, at several different times playing about the bow of the vessel, flying fish abundant, with occasionally some curious sea birds. This whole day & night has been exceedingly boisterous and unpleasant. Mon.d 19th  Morning clear, air mild, fair wind and travelling pretty fair. The sick ones of yesterday are getting lively again. no land yet in sight. pleasant evening and travelling rapidly ahead. Tues.d 20th  Morning clear, mild, with fair wind and rapid travelling within 200 miles of Tampico. Wed.nd 21st  Warm and clear. Gulf in a calm. discovered  land at 1/2 past 12 P.M. a fair breeze in the afternoon water of the Gulf getting quite green. The coast of Mexico ranges in barren and here and there partly cultivated hills. very Singular scenery. The pilots came out to us at 4 P.M. and took us into Tampico by dark, being up a small and crooked river about 6 1/2 miles. Vegetation &c was all green and the Spring verdure was here in all its richness fully displayed. The breakers running upon the shore were quite interesting and our entranceto Tampico over the bar was quite favorable. The  county about Tampico is in flats and broken hope  and there into low rolling hills of a peculiar  appearance, covered here and there with dense Chaparell. An officer boarded our vessel and examined  our passports, and we anchored off Tampico in the  river Rio Paneuco. Many porposes were playing  in the gulf as we entered the river. it was a beautiful sun set scene, and the weather quite warm.  we were not permitted to go on shore this evening. We have now arrived in Mexico, 20 1/2 days from  the wharf in Philadelphia. Clear. & Warm like August. landed this morning  at 10.A.M. in Tampico. went to the city Plaza and  examined strange costoms, dress, appearances of things &c. wandered with friends about town and suburbs all  day except when our baggage passed the Custom  House, when we had all taken to private rooms  rented for our company. Our impressions of Tampico  and the Mexicans in general, was at first quite unfavorable,  but in a few days becoming more familiarized with their  very singular manners and appearances, we felt more at home Tampico. State of Tamaulipas. Mexico. 23rd For one Real or 12 1/2 cts in company with a friend I crossed the  Rio or river Paneuco, to the shore of the State of Vera Cruz, from which place I sketched Tampico, as per plate No. 1. To a citizen of the States unaccustomed to foreign life, it at once presents an oriental appearance. There are two plaza's or public squares in the city the principal one facing the  river and the other back, upon which two of the Military posts and a small plain cathedral are located. The streets run generally at right angles, and three fourths of the  houses are one story in height, without chimnies, window glass, boards, or brick; being usually constructed either of bamboo, mud, or stone, which are generally plastered upon the exterior surface, and occasionally painted. The roof of each principal dwelling generally partaking of the usual Mexican trait, though more Americanized than  most other Mexican cities. The suburbs are almost entirely composed of cabins of Bamboo, thatched with the leaves of  the palmetto. The city is located upon a slightly undulating ground and almost entirely surrounded by water. The many singular plants with the beautiful flowers and foliage of spring combined with the lively colors of the dwellings, gave to Tampico, a singular and highly interesting appearance. The mainplaza, is paved with limestone (vide sketch No 2.) in the centre of which there is a large circular pediment of limestone rising in 6 steps, upon the summet of which there was once a monument of Santa Anna; which has been destroyed in their Revolutionary events. The building marked No 1. belongs to the British government; it is a costly and handsome establishment, and is  the head quarters for the immense quantities of silver, brought from the mines of San Louis Polosi. The markets are held every morning upon a part of this plaza. It is inferior to those in the States, though more abundantly stocked with the tropical fruits, at much less prices. Beef, fowls, fish, eggs, cheese, beans, peas, yams, tomatoes, &c with Lemons, Oranges, Bannanna's, plantains, sugar cane, coco nuts, with many vegitables supply this market at cheap rates. Almost every article kept by the Grocers, Dry good Merchants, hardware houses and other merchantile establishments of the States may be found here, but some of the are extravigantly dear. The custom house stands upon the main plaza facing a wooden pier upon the river. Coffee, sugar, rice, tea, tobacco and some other articles are virtually prohibited by their duties. Our party had about $20 worth of the essence of tea, the duties of which was over $30. No. 2 is the dwelling of Mr. Chase the American Counsil.The costom house officers are in general exceedingly punctilious and exact, but a small gold piece, has occasionally induced some of them as in other parts of the Republic, to put on  green spectacles. Our company of 40. were all presented to a tall thin and dignified praefect or chief Alcalde, who signed each pasport, for which he charged each $1. We occupied 3 large rooms in a retired part of the city,  near one of the principal barracks, and a part of the  time cooked our own provisions. We saw several military parades, as large forces were temporarily stationed here,  to prevent a rise on the part of the citizens of this city and State for independence, and annexation to Texas, or  in plain words Annexation to the United States. There was a patroll of small parties of Soldiers with  drum, fife, beaugles, &c. at almost every hour of the day. The complexion of the Mexicans is generally copper, bronze, and sometimes almost black. Their hair black and straight and their features partaking much of the Indian. I think  there is a marked difference between the features and the  color of the Spaniard and the Aztec Indian of Mexico, but they are called Mexicans. The real Aztec occupies generally the lower grades of life, but they appear tobe by far the most honest, sociable, polite, and hospitable. Though, as in other countries there are very conspicuous exceptions. The Sabbath is but little observed here, church open with most of the stores &c in the morning, and all closed in the  afternoon, for dances called fandango's, cockfights and other amusements, etc. You can get a good cup of coffee on the  plaza, or at the \"Caffe de Reverdy\" for a maydue or 6 1/4 cts. toast bread 6 1/4 cts. a cup of excellent chocolate one Real. 12 1/2 cts. eggs 12 1/2 cts per doz. about 2 1/2 lbs of coarse sugar for a  Quartee or 3 cent piece of silver. Flour is high, and bread dear. Tortelias are very common, when well made they are excellent, they are simply finely pulverized corn baked in large thin wafers, until they snap like thin sea biscuit. The Mexicans do not generally live as well nor in the  same manner as those of the States with some exceptions. I have however, tasted pastries here surpassing any thing of the  kind in the States. Good wine from 37 1/2 to 75. cts per bottle. Freoles, or black beans, plenty, cheap, and excellent. In  dress they are peculiar, with many varieties of fashion, and possibly as different from the Americans (in general) as may be found throughout the whole world. A tapering and broad rim hat called a Sombrero; often a tight  [*But meals are usually charged from 25 to 50. cts. and their appendages in proportion.*]and curiously figured buckskin jacket, over clean linen,  a pair of figured buckskin pants opening and buttoning up from top to heel, under the right and left arm, being small above and as broad as a Sailor below; they are generally unbuttoned as high as the knee or the pocket, exhibiting a pair of fine white linen pants beneath, which are also quite airy. The Mexicans are very clean in their dress, in this respect they far surpass the United States. Even our servants or mule drivers, were dressed in their  clean white linens; a thing most remarkable for this country considering their state of civilization. The Cargador or porter will carry a box or package, and yet appear not to soil his fine linen. The high tariffs of Mexico, prevent  the coarser articles from being imported, consequently the  Mexican markets abound with the finest foreign goods. The cloth, or linen is confiscated if it does not count so many threads to the inch when passing the custom house. Lands held in this country from old titles is good, but that from the government is not safe. Mr. Chase, our American  consul, says that during his stay of 15 years at Tampico, he has known the Mexican government to change 16 times consequently their laws, &c. are but temporary powers of vacilationIt is necessary to have a pasport to enter this country which will cost $2 in the States, to countersigned by the Alcalde of each large town you pass through within 48 hours after your arrival, costing at each place 25.cts. with also a pasport to leave the country; A passport to carry arms, and a passport to carry any amount of money beyond your expenses, at 25 per cent discount. Owing to the  reports respecting the country we had to pass over to San Louis Potosi, 5 of our number withdrew and proceeded by themselves. Mr Grant, then withdrew with a large portion of our company, leaving us but 19, which embodied a separate  mining company, having with them a large amount of mining tools, provisions, medicines, etc. amounting to considerable baggage which the other division thought would detain them some weeks longer in getting through to Mazatlan; consequently that party of 16 organized and proceeded some 5 days in advance of us, and procuring their horses at Mr. Laflers Rancho, or farm, they proceeded with dispatch to San Louis Potosi etc. Our party after selling off some unnecessary articles (as every pound to Mazatlan cost us 40 cts.) proceeded on the journey, having obtained our horses of Mr Lafler; 16 miles up the river of Paneuco. The other party of course expectedto be in San Louis Potosi, at least for 8 days ahead of our tardy mules and mustangs. They arrived in San Louis Potosi on the evening of the 21st of March, and our party at sun rise next morning to their surprise, as this journal from Tampico, will show. During our stay in Tampico, many of our party formed acquaintances in this city friendly to the Americans, a disposition evinced throughout the state of Tamaulipas. The weather here is quite as hot as august in the States,  but a fine sea breeze comes from the Gulf of Mexico, every afternoon; that makes our perambulations about town more pleasant. The Senioretta's or Ladies wear no bonnets, but invariably shawls upon their heads, I have seen some that were very beautiful; the early evening is their favorite time of appearance. This is decidedly a great country for moschitoes, ticks, and all kinds of loathesome vermin as we will herein after prove. The States bear not the slightest resemblance in species, quantities, and qualities to them, as they are positively the most numerous and most troublesome inhabitants of Mexico. To pick off 3 or 500 ticks from your pants and coat, as the cost of a venture in some places among the small weeds and bushes, might seem unreasonable, but such is very possible to occurSund 25th  The Priest, has extended an invitation to our company to  attend church. I visited and found but few present. The church is handsomely decorated inside but has a very  antiquated appearance without.  26th No rain and weather excessively warm, and moschetoes  innumerable, and insupportable. I repaired to the bluff  on the river, and from the highest part of it sketched  scene No 3, which comprehends an extensive and interesting  range of country. The first river to the right passing north  is the Rio Tamosee. West of it is the rio Paneuco,  a beautiful little stream meandering off towards San  Louis Potosi, and navigable 150 miles for light draught  boats, through no steamers have yet ascended it for. at fig. 1  is Laflers' Rancho 16 miles up the river; west of it for about  20 miles there is a level prairie. The Mountains fig. 2.  are interesting, as they abound with numerous ancient  walls, curiosities, and remains very similar to those discovered  in Yucatan, by Stephens. An ancient city is  supposed to have covered a number of square miles  on the summet of this mountain; which has been described by Norman of New Orleans. Beyond this west by south  two peaks of immense and distant mountains may be seen  occasionally by a clear sun set.South (fig 3) There is a long and beautiful Lagoona or Lake being about 2 miles wide, beyond it in the direction of Vera Cruz, there are high mountains and fertile plains. In the foreground there is a long tract of prarie, covered with the wild prarie grass, some chaparell bushes, with occasional  patches of low timber, and skirted on the margin of both waters with brushy trees, and one Rancho or (small) farm. [*Mond March 5th*] Weather warm, and yet no rain, but a pleasant  breeze each afternoon. Having all baggage in readiness and our bargains completed for horses and mules, we  embarked with everything belonging to our party in large canoes, in which we made the best of our way up to Laflers' Rancho 16 miles up the Rio Paneuco, to his principal farm or Haciendo, which I sketch'd as in No 4. Showing the Paneuco river, the neighboring mountain which contains its ancient remains of a past city on it and the curious forest in its foreground. This is the  best house on this river. This gentleman is an extensive landholder, his personal property extends  over more than 50 square miles, which he says he purchased some 12 or 14 years ago for $800. He came here originally from the State of Ohio. He has an immense tract, stock, grain, servants &c.and raises Sugar Cane, Coffee, bannanas, Corn, and  many other things, and is the only person I see about  this section of the country making brick. During our  short stay at this pleasant rancho, Mr Thompson, one of  our party obtained a guide over the river, and proceeded out to the ancient city upon the mountain; he reports the way to be difficult and exceedingly unpleasant, but he considered himself amply repaid in beholding some of the  scattered remains of old stone walls, parts of dwellings, implements &c. I was informed in Tampico, that a large  block of stone, appearing to have been part of a monument, was raised there, with an inscription upon the under surface, below it there was another similar block, which has not yet been removed. There are many very interesting matters there for the Antiquarian: Mr  Thompson having shot a deer, returned at Sun set with it, which  was very acceptable to our company. Our party were very much annoyed by clouds of voracious moschetoes, and other exceedingly repugnant insects swarming upon all the undergrowth and weeds of this region of country. At this Haciendo, our dinners were of the best the  country afforded, including a great variety of new dishes.Tuesd 6th Day clear and very warm; our baggage was repacked and carefully weighed; and likewise assorted for mule loads. Horses, mules, and pack saddles was the business of the day Wed 7th Day clear and hot. This morning opened with the buz of preparation for marching to Mazatlan; but for many unprepared considerations, it was postponed one day. Thursd 8th Day clear and hot. Having hired our mules, mustangs and four servants from Mr Lafler, and our guide Don Francisco, being in command as director of our order of march, as interpreter, Sub Commissary &c. and our other officers being elected -- and having carefully loaded all our arms -- we commenced our line of march, -- at 10 A.M. upon an extensive levil and variegated prairie. Westward ho! all in lively spirits; the first large city to which we  looked forward with interest, was San Louis Potosi,  a distance from Tampico of about 350 miles, though variously estimated from 3 to 400 miles according to route. The appearance of our company completely equipped with with guns, rifles, revolvers, knives, swords, &c. was anything but pleasant for a guerrilla to look at, some of which we anticipated meeting. half the day we marched upon a prairie plain, a part of whichhad no timber and scarcely any vegetation. We passed a  pleasant little lake upon which there was an immense quantity of wild game, that was easily approached. in the afternoon we got among some woodland hills, with  a small allowance of very bad water. Our road was only  a very indifferent mule path, and not passible for a  vehicle of any kind, and continues thus quite to S.L. Potosi. On the way we saw immense droves of cattle and horses, roving at large upon the prairies. In the afternoon we  passed a caravan from San Louis Potosi. The road being very dusty, the sun excessively hot, water scarce and bad,  and but little available shade; we were of course quite glad to close this days journey, in camp at a small bamboo hut, on the bank of the Rio Paneuco. - and an  interesting group of dusty travellers we were too, with  a regular saw mill appetite. Freoles, or black beans, with  coffee and corn tortelias, were served round for supper, and notwithstanding they were previously out of credit; they passed very current on this occasion. Our beds and blankets were then spread at random upon the  ground in the open air; and a guard of two set, for every two hours of the night, on the first of which I served two  hourswith my comrade Mr Bods, being from 8 to 10. An early Moon rose upon the meandering and placid waters of the beautiful Rio Paneuco, and a gentle breeze played  fitfully in the overarching foliage around over camp. This was a fit time to remind one of those pleasant evenings at home, of scenes in our native land. Friday 9th Day clear & hot. Got on march before daylight and marched 9 leagues, (27 miles) through a hot sun, dusty paths, winding hither and thither over small hills and bushy plains of no peculiar interest, with no dinner  and a short allowance of very bad limestone water. This evening we anchored again a bamboo cabin, on the banks of the Rio Paneuco, very similar to the last, and found a very short allowance of provisions at  this place. A part of our party went into the river to bathe and found the water quite warm. They were cautioned  however about Alligator gars &c, which are  sometimes dangerous. We camped again in the open air. Sat 10th Day clear & hot. Commenced our march before daylight; being 7 leagues (21 miles) for the day. Travelled most of this day over plains, covered with forest of  palm trees, with dense undergrowth of palmettos.from which the palm fans are made, this change of  scenery was new and very interesting to us. It reminded  me much of the descriptions of palm forrest in Africa and  India, frequently for miles we saw no other trees than  several varieties of the palm, sometimes scattering, and  at others compact reminding one too of the Jersey pines, when seen at a distance. These palms afford but little shade, and grow here usually to the height of from 40 to 50 feet, without branches or leaves, save only upon their very summets. An American unaccustomed to such  very singular scenes cannot comprehend fully from description the majesty they impose at first sight upon the mind of the lover of the wild in Nature. View us winding our way in single file, with baggage mules in advance, with coats off, and red flannen, as  conspicuous; with arms glistening in the mid days sun, the arrearo's or mule drivers singing out with their incessant \"mulah\", the guide ahead  smoking his cigaretto, or little paper cigar, and the  rest of the travellers following like a flock of spring birds in complete tune, and merry felicity, among dust, sunshine, and the shadeless forrests of palm. [*20*] In places however the palms, and palmettos arched over our road.and gave us a partial shade for a short period, then we would come up on an open plain, followed by a regular forrest of various trees, massive, dense, and overgrown with immense vines, and peculiar trees for occasional undergrowth; next a few small hills, then a brushy plane, followed again and again with the forrests of palm. Parrots and many other birds of gay plumage were very abundant and exceedingly noisy. Here and there the grass and brush have been fired and burned off for many miles. We encamped again at a bamboo cabin on the Rio Paneuco, very similar to the last, here again most of our party bathed in the river. I saw some diminutive watermellons at this Rancho, and helped to taste one. Our fare at this place was reasonable, but charges superior. The water is still very indifferent and strong of limestone. 11th Day clear and hot. Started early for a Rancho on the  Tamouin & Paneuco. 9 leagues (27 miles) The scenery of this day was much diversified and interesting with palms, plains, hills, gullies, brushes, and forrests. Among which I saw very many curious Banyan trees, or the wild figg tree. So curious were they, that if time had permitted I should have, certainlysketched a number of them. I think it is the same species of the Banyan tree of India. I saw several  cases of palm trees completely imbedded in the very trunks of immense Banyan trees, and being quite ornamental  to it. This tree returns from its from its branches direct  in a perpendicular line very frequently to the ground  in long cords like ropes, which take root and spring up again, in many shapes and sizes, and in many  cases more than a hundred times from one large tree. On this days march we saw several curious Mounds. We arrived at the Tamowin about 3.P.M, and after sending all baggage over with ourselves in [a] canoes,  we finished our crossing by swimming the horses & mules,  on the opposite bank we encamped at a large and  good looking Rancho, being at the junction of the  rivers Paneuco and Tamowin. Here we purchased a calf of good size for $.3.00, and prepared him accordingly, for further use upon the way. Water still unpalatable. This evening a part of our company were in to swim again. From circumstances we inferred trouble with guerrillas, but the guards were vigilant, and we left at 1.O.clock next  morning winding over way through a forest by moonlight.Mond. 12th Day clear & hot. Proceeded by early moonlight (1.O. clock) on our way for Villa de Viase. At sunrise we arrived at the first- Mountain on our way called the \"Siera Madre\" or Mother Mountain. Before entering the pass, the traveller will find a valuable warm Sulpher Spring, of great medicinal properties not far from the path. As you approach the pass, the scene is peculiar. You walk and lead your Mustangs over a rocky path, of such barbarous rudeness that you may deem it a venture for a Mountain goat, and yet your horse must be taxed with all his personal wits to puzzle his way out over loose rocks that edge over the precipice of an almost bottomless uncertainty. The mules, -they are as sharp as Chatham Yankees, for they will carry a load, where a common man would want room to tout over his own shadow. They are perfect baggage wild cats, and climb rocks with heavy loads as if they had claws, or were cammels in the desert of Arabia. We passed over one high and exceedingly dangerous precipice,  and other unpleasant places, and finally passed through a very narry and precipitous valley that meandered like the bed of a little river diagonally across the mountain, with almost the slightgrade of a rail road, and generally not much over 300 feet in width, but steep and of great height with timber on each side edging up the mountains, the meanderings of this cavern-valley  with its hight cliffs, and little coves and passes, gave to the whole scene a peculiar wildness and Sublimity. We scared up five young deer among the rocks; It was in this mountain pass that from report, we first  anticipated some Mexican Indians, or Guerillas; in this pass they could sweep and be safe; and although our guns were several times fired, none made their appearance to us. After crossing the mountain pass, we came upon an undulating country still uninhabited, though in many places of a very rich soil, covered sometimes with good timber and now and then prarie grass, with occasional barrens of wild and cavernous limestone rocks. Entrances to caves are to be seen, and in one place a romantic spot, an immense well of an oval form descends perpendicularly through limestone rocks to a great debth. Some ancient trees bend gracefully over and around its mouth. To day also, I found the remains of an ancient town and the appearance of an ancient fort on our way to the village de Viase. Revd Mr Woods and myself passed on in the advance of the trainMarch, 1849.  a mile or two, with the view of arriving at the village in  advance of the train. on the way just as we had pas a  slight bend of the road, we saw five uncouth looking Mexicans sitting on the bank of a dry creek; the wispered suspiciously until we came beside them, when they all arose at once with sticks, and gathered around us, supposing something rong on foot, I drew my gun from its sheath, and exhibited also my revolver and knife. Mr Woods prepared himself also by exarming his gun &c. These fellows followed us a short distance evidently meditating our arms, when they fell  off from us on being told that many Americans were just behind. We arrived in the village early in the afternoon, and found Mr Grants division just on the point of leaving for S.L. Potosi. This being the place where all our horses had to be shod for the mountains to come. We encamped on the village plaza, pitched our tents, prepared our own food, &c. Tuesd 13th Day hot and clear, examined the appearance of the village with friends, and obtained a good bowl of coffee two eggs and bread on the plaza for 1 Real, 12 1/2 cts. We have discovered that  Milk, Eggs, freeoles, tortelias, Oranges, and Coffee may be  readily obtained at almost every place; all of which  are very cheap, except coffee. On the Plaza of thisvillage there stands the remains of an Ancient Catholic Church. The Cupola is yet in a tollerable State of preservation and 3 bells yet hang in it of a very Anti- quated appearance. Upon its summet shrubs, cactus, grass may be seen as luxuriant as upon Terra firma. Vide sketch No 5. To the right of it is a long bamboo  building thatched with palmetoes; in it the Catholic citizens hold their Service. From appearances within we judge this chappel to contain more real wealth than many of those magnificent edifices of the States. This day was occupied in Shoeing our horses. Mr. Lafler of Tampico came in the village some 90 miles from his Rancho in order to have them properly attended too, the Shoes having been brought here from Tampico. The price of Shoeing here is from 3 to 5 dollars per horse, in the States about one dollar. Here they most generally throw the animal upon the  ground and tie him there with ropes. The Smith shops and other mechanical departments appear more like burlesques than the representation of a half civilized people. This morning I ascended the cupola of the plaza ruins and then beheld a beautiful view of the Siera Madre Mountains 12 miles westward as in Sketch No. 6.The foreground from the mountain was nearly a levil plane, intersperced here and there with apparent clearings, which in several cases proved to be small open and natural praries, probably never cleared by the hand of man, as they were not much used. A small rapid and romantic river passes under a deep bluff beside the village, where our party were again into bathe, as the day was excessively hot and the water agreeable. The peaks of the Siera Alta, appeared like a cloud in the distance. In offering a pass to the  traveller these mountains are very high and formidable. Just as I had completed this sketch the priest of the parish a very pleasant man ascended the tower and expressed much pleasure at finding me sketching, and thereupon requested me to descend and dine with him, to which I complied with much pleasure, in descending the tower in a shady recess, he placed my arms around  himself he also embraced me, with much feeling, and said that he liked the Americans. His dinner was served  up in the best Mexican style, with wine and numerous new dishes, served in about 8 or10 changes of plates. I left much gratified with his hospitality. Our horses being in readiness, at 4.P.M. we commenced our marchtoward the foot of the Siera Madre Mountains. In leaving and crossing the river by the ford, it was very gratifying to see about 90 or 100 Mexicans upon the high bluffs and along the road to see us out and bid us a friendly adieu, and Adios, adios, adios, was echoed here, there and yonder, which signifies - \"to God\"- we commend you. We travelled some 10 miles this evening and camped in a wild spot about 2 miles from the foot of the mountain. My sketchbook, a satchell, and a coat belonging to Mr Sayre, were lost after dark before camping, but 3 of us returned by moonlight before sun rise and found them. Our camp fire looked really interesting this evening with the sentinals parading around the sleepers who where rolled  up in blankets; who constantly watched among the timbers and bushes for enemy and wholves, the latter of which made themselves known before daylight. [*Wedn 14th.*] Day hot & clear. Arose before before daylight and proceeded to the Siera Madre Mountain. As we ascended, I observed numerous scattering mounds, parts of old walls &c, the timber became large and dense. I believe that there is a spring (the only one from Tampico to S Louis Potosi) not far from the road to the right as you ascend the mountain.our path over the mountain was in ascent by windings about 3 miles, and nearly the same in descending over the opposite side and other hills. The whole scenery was wild beyond description. Could this road or path be exhibited in a civilized country, it would be considered dangerous even for a mountain goat; how then shall I describe it, when a painter would consider it beyond a just representation if skillfully drawn. We lead our horses up the  steep precipitous masses, jumping and scrambling from  rock to rock sometimes two feet perpendicularly. The most ragged and cragged ledges, holes, chasms, and peaks that  the mind could picture for feats in horsemanship. Reader! you have doubtless seen nominally bad roads in the States, but they convey only a faint idea of the  hardships you must encounter in passing the formidable crags upon these mountains of distracted rudeness. Having surmounted the first Series, we descended upon  similar sharp and pointed edges into a wild and  romantic cove, leading off over and around other more  passable hills, in full view of numerous mountains ranging at random in every direction, until we reached the Ranch la Pier, by a small lakeupon a beautiful plane, and here we encamped for the night, having arrived early in the afternoon. The proprietor of the Rancho, is an Alcalde of wealth, and a man of affable manners. Before sun set we ascended a neighboring hill and sketched scene No. 7. including a large assemblage of distant mountains. The setting sun cast back their shadows upon the planes, as I descended, and lent a passing beauty to them ever to be remembered. From advice given us by the Alcalde, it was thought advisable to change our rout over the mountains to San Louis Potosi, by a nearer and more safe direction. The Mexican forces, and Indians or Guerrillas, being  upon the regular route, which would cause us trouble. The first division having gone that way unadvised, they met with difficulties, detention, and considerable danger. Thurs 15th Day clear & hot. Entered upon the nearer route, and passed palm forrests, old fortifications, and a fine little river, where  we filled our canteens with refreshing and cool water, the best from Tampico, and accomplished a long march and 6 or 7 formidable mountains of worse paths than any previously travelled. To describe our labours on these volcanic rocks of gothic masonry, would be romantic indeed.but suffice it to be said that this days march was  the most wild rugged and exhausting of any to San Louis Potosi. On this route I had the pleasure of discovering a  magnificent cavernous Amphitheatre of several thousand feet in diameter, and about 300 feet in perpendicular  debth, covered below with dense timber, and overhung with high arching cliffs of great magnificence. Our mountain scenery today was exceedingly grand though we enjoyed it but little owing to the difficult passes to be encountered. Many of the mountains had no timber, nor even vegetation upon them; being vast masses of rude brown rocks particularly upon their summets. Had time permitted, I should have sketched some of these alpine scenes of barrenness for the information and curiosity of my friends and readers. They are totally unlike anything I ever before saw  in point of complete barrenness and appeared really savage. At sunset we descended into a romantic valley and wound around several Sugarloaf hills, by dark into the beautiful village of San Nicholas, where we encamped upon a pleasant plaza of grass in the midst of the village and at the foot of a large and imposing mountain.but suffice it to be said that this days march was the most wild rugged and exhausting of any to San Louis Potosi.

At sun set we descended into a romantic valley and wound round several Sugarloaf hills, by dark into the beautiful village of San Nicholas, where we encamped upon a pleasant plaza of grass in the midst of the village and at the foot of a large and imposing Mountain.seen bearing much resemblance to a volcano. Whilst watering our horses at a pond in this valley, two suspicious Mexicans appeared, one over the pond, and the other near us apparently examining our arms, &c. and in a short time one of them made bold to tell two of our party that  he was one of a party defeated by the Mexican Government, and that they were many, who were now in persuit of  plunder, both of them were handsomely dressed, and rode upon first class animals. We turned to the left from this interesting valley, through a pass in the hills similar to  No 9. when we came in view of the beautiful and-- romantic village of Tortugas, or village of turtles, where we arrived at 4 P.M. and located ourselves in a  small brush school house, upon a small riding ground well adapted to defence, as an attack of the Guerrillas was looked for, as quite certain during the night. Many of the inhabitants collected around us with curiosity and pleasure, as they hoped we would be of service to them in case of an attack of the Guerrillas or robbers. We were all in anticipation of a fight, when we saw a small fire upon the summit of a neighboring mountain, supposed to be a signal light. Guns, pistols &c were allwith here and there patches of stunted vegetation, growing among the wild mountain rocks. Among these I saw a number of strange and interesting trees, curious plants, magueys, palmettoes, coco's, and a strange fruit resembling the pine apple, being twice as large, and filled with numerous small soft white fruits, much resembling in appearance and taste the common chesnut, which were very abundant on one of the mountains. I also saw a shrub or bean plant bearing flowers, resembling skeins of white & red silk, from 1 to 2 inches in thickness, and from 4 to 6 inches in length. On this days march we passed through many very peculiar mountains, scenes of interest. No 9 (sketch.) was taken on horseback whilst passing into the valley of corn. No 10. is a view of the Valle de Maise, or valley of corn, looking to the north. This valley is about one mile in width, and many in length. The hills upon either side are nothing of nearly void of vegetation, the whole valley is divided into large fields for corn, and well improved with stone fences. The soil is rich and corn flourishes here luxuriantly. Far on the northern horizon a high mountain wasall of which grew from 4 to 15 feet in height, and chiefly among the interstices of the rocks. It appeared to be a  section of country almost useless for any purpose, and it  really appeared strange, how such a barren wilderness of  of thorns could be at all inhabited where water was  also very bad and scarce; in the afternoon we travelled among clouds of dust, with a hot sun and but little breeze. before sunset we encamped under a tree, beside, a desolate mud dwelling upon a deasert plane, much like a scene in the desert of Arabia, appearing quite as barren and  forlorn, as the immagination could well picture as in sketch No 13. A large old fashioned rope and pulley well, was in the  vicinity, at which about 40 Mexican women, were engaged in drawing water, and carrying it away in large earthen jars upon their heads, bearing a striking resemblance to the old Egyptian costoms, in dress, color, and manners. At this place we fared slim and paid well for it. Sund 18th   Day clear and warm. Proceeded on our journey at 6.A.M. very  anxious to get out of this barren and sandy wilderness. and travelled nearly all day over diversified planes of  limestone, palms, maguays, casters, some timber, and for a  mile or two, for the first time a woodland of beautiful cedars.put in the best order, our camp fire put out, and two guards put on duty. The Alcalde paid us a friendly visit, and many of the inhabitants brought us cheap provissions, and the night passed off without trouble. [*Sat. 17th.*] Day clear and warm. The inhabitants came in numbers to bid us a friendly adios. I pencil'd sketches No 11. and 12. just before leaving showing on No 11. our position in camp at the school house, and an opposite view looking South. Oranges flourish here, and are  very cheap, eggs are plentiful, with many useful articles of provissions. Soon after leaving this pleasant village, we ascended several large and barren hills, and in a few hours descended a very romantic pass down upon prarie plains and cultivated fields. our views on this days journey were extensive new diversified and interesting. We came to a  small village of a very romantic appearance, beside a little stream of water, where at first the inhabitants were much terrified at our appearance. We saw but little timber, during the whole day, the planes and  hills, being almost covered with wild cactus, prickley pears, and the short scrubby palms, etc.At intervals for several miles, the ground was as white as the very snow of a northern winter, having a saline taste, in places, in others that of Epsom Salts, and as fine as the very best flour. Caverns were beneath, for we  could often hear the footsteps of our horses echoing beneath, and now and then a chasm or deep pit would  appear. When timber appeared in the usual form of groups or clusters, it usually had a singular appearance, much resembling extensive Apple, and  Peach orchards. The country had conspicuous marks of a volcanic origin upon a limestone foundation. We were almost constantly in sight of distant ranges of lofty and rugged mountains, lending romance to the day. and now and then large planes, covered with prairie grass would extend for before the eye to the mountains skirted here and there with pleasant shady woodlands. We arrived at the Hacienda about 4. P.M. and were  gratified to find it a place much superior to the last,  not only for provisions, but also for shade and comfort. About 9.O.clock this morning we arrived at a place on the valley plane, where a stream of clear and very strong limestone water meandered from a small lake, and in a short distancedisappeared beneath the ground; this water though clear and cold, was so strongly impregnated with the Carbonate of lime, that though we were very thirsty, we could scarcely drink it. During a temporary halt, I sketch'd this lake No. 12 [*14*], and its vicinity southward. Game was plentiful here, and  several of our party delay'd some on account of it. Mr Sherman, one of the same , remained there so long that  in persuit of our caravan he missed the path and  was lost for a day and a half suffering greatly from exposure and other great dangers; after some delay, expense,  and trouble in scouring the country in various directions with a Mexican guide, he was at last found, much fatigued frightened, and sick, having encountered considerable perils. I remained some time behind the company in waiting for  Sherman, as long as I felt it safe from missing the way  myself, expecting him to come up upon this path, [during that time I sketched scene No 14. a high] on our right there was a high mountain [to] [the North] bearing the marks of a large volcano. Some of our party were in to bathe again this evening, but as our journey has elevated us much, the water is now becoming cooler especially each night, which is cold enough for two or three blankets, whilst  the mid day sun is quite hotMond 19th Day warm and clear. Proceeded on our journey at 7.O. clock. sMuch of this days journey was very similar to the last, at times winding among barren hills, small planes of cactus, thorns scattering palms, gullies and rocks, with small groves of peculiar trees of a stunted growth. Before sun set we crossed a beautiful and fertile plane under cultivation with corn, and haulted for a short time at a large well on one of the fields one and a half liles from, and in full view of the beautiful little town of Ceretus de San Juan; at the suburbs of which we encamped within a large yard for the  night. Before day light had left the hills of Ceretus, I passed through several parts of the town, and Sketched the church and plaza as in No 15. Showing the valley and hills eastward, over which we had passed during the after part of the day. The appearance of this little town is quite genteel the houses being mostly constructed of Stone and frequently whitewashed and as often secluded in pleasant Shady yards and groves of the trees and shrubs peculiar to this country.Tuesd 20th  Day warm and clear. Proceeded on our journey at 6.O.clock. Just as we were leaving the yard the horse belonging to Mr Thompson, taking fright at some object ran off through the yard, and brok his rifle into many small pieces, Mr T.--escaping unhurt. About 1 mile from  Ceretus, looking westward, I sketched scene No 16. showing the barren hills, a hacienda to the right, and the little clusters of bushes, dotting the ground like miniature islands. We were among the hills and ravines all day, and passed up one very interesting pass between barren mountains which was several  miles in length. On the way before entering this pass,  and at the commencement of a fine broad road, we  halted for a short time at a large Hacienda, called San  E Pedro No 17. having westward a beautiful mountain view, south the cultivated fields and distant hills, and around the dwelling several beautiful groves, over the principal door was painted in large letters, \"Casa Particular\". It being a public house or hotel of the  Mexican order. Having ascended through peculiar scenes of the passes, to the summet of the mountains, we then passed a long time over a wild rocky and entirely desolatewilderness, almost entirely destitute of the smallest vegetation, except in some particular spots, where small stone & mud huts of misery were now and then to be seen. Before descending we passed a small mud village in a little rocky and desolate ravine; with only a few cactus, thorns, and stunted brush, but no regular timber about it. It looked much like solitude and misery. The road has now become excellent, and for the first time we found it graded and paved as a regular road up the mountain. Wooden crosses are plentiful and conspicuous, they are more numerous now than on the way back to Tampico; Sometimes two or three in sight of each other may be seen and particularly on this days march. We are told that these crosses are erected upon the particular spots, where travelers have been murdered. if so, this is decidedly a great country. As we descended the mountain, winding our way down a dangerous pass, a beautiful plane, with a range of barren mountains 15 miles westward, appeared before us, which I hastily sketched as our party descended to the plane, as in number 18. This plane is about 15 miles in width, and almost entirely covered with a brush peculiar to this country.This plane, of the valley is quite level and of very great length, the camino that crosses it, is at least 100 feet broad, and would be an elegant road for travel if not so abundantly supplied with dust and sand. Our party were so much enveloped in dust, that during a portion of the time some of them were not distinguishable at the distance of a few rods. Clouds of dust arose high in the air, and marked in places the spots where persons were moving on many parts of the plane. Such scenes have however been long familiar to us from the very city of Tampico. At sun set we arrived at the \"Meson De Fern\" a public house called Pestelius located in a desert of sand, a few miles from a village to the north west and off from the road. At this place, we found Capt Grants' division of the Camargo Company, who met us in a sociable manner as old friends, the two divisions having taken different roads to San Louis Potosi.. Mr Chevallias' party of 5 having also arrived the whole Camargo Company were again together. At night, a high wind arose and gave us a complete storm of dust, exceeding anything of the kind that I have ever before witnessed in any country, reminding one of the desert of Arabia.Wednd 21st Day warm and clear. Capt. Grants division, left before sunrise in order to reach San Louis Potosi before night. Our company proceeded on the way an hour after, as we did not design pressing our horses and mules with a very long days march. Nos 19 and 20 are exterior and  interior views of the desert house where we camped. To the right of the house, there is a large well, which is deserving of notice; two or three hoses are fastened by beams to a vertical shaft, which by 8 right angle sticks move a horizontal beam, to which there is a wheel about 12 feet in diameter, with ropes and  about 20 leather buckets, for raising water from the  well to a trough, and from thence into a stone bason  about 60 feet square, and 8 or 10 feet in debth. This water was fair and cool, and very desirable for the country. Such wells are not frequent, and found only occasionally at the large Haciendo's or Ranchoe's of the wealthy. Water on this road from Tampico to  San Louis Potosi, is scarce, and in almost every instance very unpalatable, muddy, and dangerous to the stranger. It is therefore nescessary for travellers to be cautious in drinking the water along this route                                                                      in particular. This days journey was very similar to the last, with hills and dusty roads, with a hot sun, brushy planes, thorns, and large cactus of various forms, &c. Mountains of barren rocks were seen all day, but we travelled chiefly upon the planes. About 4 in the afternoon we arrived at the Rancho de los Soledad, previous to which I sketched scene No. 21 as we descended to the valley in which this rancho is located, This plane is very wide, and a very considerable length, on this plane about 30 miles to the left is located the city of San Louis Potosi, in full view of large Mountains, though not within several miles of any of them. No. 22 is a sketch of the Haciendo or \"Rancho de los  Solidad\", and its neighboring mountain, which I sketched before sun set, this scene is looking S. East. We encamped opposite to this in a large Mud wall with appartments for travellers as in Sketch No. 23. The inhabitants are now becoming less friendly than they were back over the mountains. And are decidedly against the Americans in the popular feeling, and have occasionally expressed those feelings with insults, and a few words of contempt, which some of them have learned from the American deserters, in the English language. We have seen a number of these contempitible shadows of white men and almost as often heard their curses, or indecent language, but we have generally left them unnoticed. At this rancho we saw a large amount of arms and lances, with an American Rifle, pistols, swords &c which led us to suspicion the character of the place strongly; we however kept our Arms and Sentinels in good trim, and were ready at the word, to show them that in defence we were the same original Americans that they might have before read about. Had our numbers been small enough to suit their taste, I have no doubt but that a fight would have resulted judging from all circumstances, questions, &c. Being in the neighborhood of S. L. Potosi, it is now absolutely nescessary to be constantly on your gard for all shapes of thieves, Robbers, Guerillos, &c., etc, etc. who appear to compose a large proportion of the population. [*Thursd 22nd*]  We left the Rancho, this morning at 3. O. clock for San  Louis Potosi, the road was broad, and lined with cactus, from 5 to 15 feet in height. We were all awake for any attack on the way. Having travelled 15 miles by 1/2 past 8.O. clock A.M. we entered the Splendid and singular city of San Louis Potosi, having passed through a beautiful little village before entering Potosi. The city is situated upon a large and beautiful plane, which is under good cultivation, and is for several miles in every direction; divided into regular right angle  \"streets and roads. The fences of the roads, if they may be so called are composed of the high pentangular cactus, growing in single stems of about 5 inches diameter to a  height of about 8, 10, or 15 feet, and frequently so close together that it is generally capable of shutting out the smallest animal. The average width of the streets are about 30 feet. A member of large and handsome species of trees range along them, with which I am not familiar, one of which resembles in bark, limb, and  site, the Locust, with leaf of a small fern. Another, has the shape and height of a poplar, with the denseness of the black thorn hedges of the States; it is a  beautiful tree of a dark green color, and very ornamental. The maguay is another peculiar plant, very abundant here; I have seen fences made of them extending many miles at a time, and very common everywhere  onour way from Tampico. All these interesting plants, trees &c. with a large number that would be  difficult to describe, but which nevertheless are exceedingly beautiful, belong to this country and are so abundant as at times to cover many miles in compact masses, so much so that it would be difficult for a man to pass among them as they all, with but little exception possess luxuriant crops of  thorns. All these species crowd the roads and surround the fields as you pass into San Louis Potosi. I also for the first time saw two peach trees in full blossom in a beautiful garden at the suburbs of the city. And many beautiful flowers of singular beauty were in full bloom likewise and filled the air with the richness of their morning fragrance. Several fine fields of ripe barley added to the view, their mellow orange hues, whilst, the plough (a rude woodden concern) was busy beside. The Orange, Lemons, and fig trees were also handsome when blended with their fruits, beneath other more conspicuous trees, among which was one called the Peru, another the China tree, andyet another larger and decorated with more exquisite brilliance than I have ever before witnessed. all these with their charming colors and luxuriance bent gracefully over our dusty roads as we passed into the great central metropolis of Potosi. The morning sun had already arrisen upon the domes, towers and minarets of Potosi, as our company entered it from the North. There was so much of the grand and the humble combined, that I could not but remark its resemblance to what I had read of St Petersburg and Moscow, as described by travellers in Russia. After wending in single file our tortuous way amid dense crowds of strange brown faces, around the various streets of the city we at last took up our quarters at the St Anthony house, which was commodious and  constructed strictly after the Mexican order, and one of the first hotels in the city, though, not by any means adapted to the ideas of Americans, being very similar to sketches Nos. 19. and 20. The suburbs of the city (which are very extensive) are almost entirely composed of miserable looking one story flat roof'd mud dwellings of a dilapidated appearance which are much inferior to  the [*34*]very lowest order of dwellings found in any part of the  States, and contrast in a very striking manner with the numerous splendid sanctuaries, public buildings, towers, domes, and superfluous grandeur of the interior city. None of our company even dreamed of the surprising splendours, which broke so suddenly upon them, when they entered the thronged plazas amid the thousands of vacant gazers who seem'd to view us as some unearthly intruders, just draft among them from some other plannet. Our ideas were never so much unhinged at when too closely crowded by dense throngs of starving Mexicans, who with wondrous eyes and  open mouths, Knew not in decency where to end their extravagant curiosity. As we entered the  streets were quick ly thronged, the windows and  iron gratings filled with Seniorettas or Ladies, the doors with wise heads and muchatcha's of boys with some upon the very house tops, to the  Americans enter into the precincts of their almost forbidden walls of China. An unfriendly feeling towards the Americans was soon evident from their language  as it was a day of religious ceremonies, and rest from labor, the church and plaza was thronged, by Mexicans dressed in their holliday best. We passed through this pleasant town, without halting and ascended a steep, high and rugged mountain at the immediate suburbs of the town. On looking back towards Amattitan, distant 14  miles to the South east and Tekelah at its base I hastily sketched the view as in No 59. On ascending this mountain I saw an animal of the Lizard Species about 2 feet in  length lying upon a large boulder rock in a ravine. After ascending we passed several miles through a  a deep, [and] very narrow, and crooked ravine among the highland hills; it was perfectly adapted to the purposes of Ladrones or Robbers, and has been recently the theatre of bloody deeds, robberies, &c. Here jet black Quartz began to appear plentiful after passing in single file for Several miles under the arches and bluffs of this wild and narrow ravine, we descended into a small and pretty valley, where there was a small farm, green fields and some water, from  this we ascended large hills, almost composed of  [*35*]the same brittle jet black quartz, before named. So much so, that it was hard upon the feet of our animals, we again descended into a gently sloping valley of about two miles in width, at the far northern end of which we could see the interesting Lake of Madalena, which I sketched on a nearer approach as in No 60. Showing the town of Madalena on the margin of the Lake, beyond which that welcome sheet of water with its interesting mountain scenery appeared, reminding one much of similar scenes in Italy and Switzerland; and rather unlike many other Mexican towns. At this place we stopped in a comfortable mason overnight, halting about 4 P.M. An opportunity offering I went and upon the margin of the lake and sketched view No 61 looking west among the mountains over which the sun was setting. Also No 62 looking south east towards part of the town Madalena is a town of a shady and pleasant appearance. Most of its streets are narrow and crooked, but well shaded in general. The plaza, was of good size and had a fine large antiquated church upon the south eastern side of it. Around which there was a large crowd of worshippers,uncivil manners, and in two of our party being stoned upon the city plaza; all of which we readily discovered and were particularly cautious, in being upon our guard, whilst we were frequently rendering civilities for incivilities. To these however we are happy to state that there were a number of exceptions, among the higher classes, and the better informed, which gave us a better opinion of Potosi, than we otherwise should  have had. We were nearly three days in this interesting city during which time whilst our guide was preparing fresh mustangs &c for our further journey to Mazatlan; and having some opportunities, I availed myself of them in visiting and sketching some of the massive and beautiful churches &c, having first obtained permission from an alcalde's clerk in the Governors' Palace, to visit and sketch as I wish'd. I proceeded in company with an American friend about 1 1/2 miles south from  the city, towards the Mosa Mountain, where from the remains of an old mud fort, I sketched the domes  &c of the city as in No 24. nearly all of which belong to magnificent churches erected many years past by the Spaniards at enormous costs, and decorated  in theinterior with gorgeous and the most exhorbitant displays of wealth and splendour that the human immagination could well conceive of, and far exceeding any thing of the kind to be found in the States. An open plane of more than a mile in extent each way extended between the fort and the city, upon which several hundred Mexican soldiers were exercising with targets, drilling &c. At this time large forces are concentrated here, who appear to be preparing for political struggles for power. To the right of this open plane, there are four parallel rows of the beautiful Alamo trees forming a shady and a very pleasant walk of about one mile from the city proper southward to the front  of the magnificent sanctuary (Santoario) as in fig 25. At each end and along this walk there are handsomely ornamented fountains. No 25 is a view of the Sanctuary and Mosa Mountains from the same position, where fig 24 was taken. A nearer view of the Sanctuary was then taken from the front near a fountain, as in fig 26, including two fountains two neat gardens, and the style of seats surrounding the principal fountain. The workmanship upon this magnificent edifice appears to be a contribution of the various orders ofArchitecture which in execution I believe to be superior to any thing similar which I have seen in the States. Not even excepting Trinity Church in New York, and composed of a hard red sand stone very similar to the one named. This church though over a mile from the city was under military guard, from whom I asked permission to enter but was told that the chief key of the Sanctuary was in the posession of the Captain, who was out drilling his  men upon the plane beforementioned. On returning to the city we passed a number of handsome edifices of  singular and antiquated appearance, but my opportunities limited me in sketching many of them. The streets were thronged in almost every direction, and should one attempt a sketch in their presence, a crowd of noisy gabbling superstitious men, women, and children, would soon compell a retreat, at the risk of being stoned, amid the jeers, and language suiting degraded and grossly ignorant minds. I was told there were over fifty handsome Sanctuaries or churches in this city, which from appearances I doo not doubt. None but the Catholic religion is tolerated here as in other parts of the Republic, and in passing each Sanctuary, even upon the opposite side of the street, the person is required to takeoff his hat, and retain it in his hand, until he has passed the door of the Sanctuary, otherwise he is liable to be stoned at the shortest notice; if nothing worse may happen him. I'm entering the church during service he is required to kneel, and to accompany respectfully in the ceremonies of the church. The interior splendors of these numerous churches, I could not describe in justice within my present compass. Their displays are gorgeous in the highest degree of man's ingenuity; and frequently exhibit much of the Theatrical; in some instances the walls and high gothic roof, being entirely covered with thousands of gothic (relief) devices, are entirely gilt with gold or silver leaf, until the whole interior glitters like a solid golden palace, with richly ornamental chandaliers, lights of various colors, hundreds of Statues of life size, adorned in robes of brilliant colors, gems, in great profusion, magnificent organs, select gallaries for the paintings, relicts, and statues of the saints, in one apartment of the St Domingo Sanctuary I was shown the bones of saints, and such other things as would fill a volume to describe.On returning to the main plaza, I sketched the Palace  of the governor as in fig 27. a crowd of noisy belligerents soon manifested a a jeering aspect, which compelled me  to finish my sketch rather hastily. I then passed off hastily until I had eluded the noisy crowd of  ignorammus's and by permission getting upon the  roof of a house. I sketched therefrom the beautiful  and very extensive Sanctuary of \"San Francisco\" as in  fig 28. showing its domes, cupolas, and spires as it appeared from the North east corner. Its bells  are numerous of many tones, and remarkably fine; the  interior like an immense museum, is crowded, with  wealth, and splendours beyond description. It has  as near as I can judge over, one thousand apartments,   a part of which are very elegant in their styles, guildings,  statues, paintings, stuccoed works, altars, tombs, vaults,  organs, galleries, painted domes, stained glass, chandeliers, massive gilt gothic works &c. &c. It covers a large  square, and is almost a royal city of itself. I after proceeded  to the Church and College of St. Josephs, which I  sketched as in No 29. My visits also extended to the magnificent  Sanctuary of St. Domingo, the front of which wasGuarded by a large mounted Cannon, and in a house, beside it several hundred soldiers. The interior of this great  church was the most gorgeous I ever beheld, its walls  and gothic ceiling was so gilt with gold leaf, as to appear  like one immense golden gothic palace. The Captain  of this division politely accompanied me through the  church, explaining its sacred relicts, &c. Among which  I saw immages of Angels, about 4 feet in height appearing to be cast of Gold, encased in splendid cases over  the grand Altar. A similar image of the Virgin  and Saviour sitting upon a throne of very massive  silver clouds, over which was an immense dome  inlaid with porcelain of rich colors. There was A large and  beautiful Organ upon a highly ornamented gallery, resting  upon Lions, that seemed watching the congregation,  And numerous saints in richest robes, (of nearly full  size) were to be seen in every direction. The interior  forum of the church was that of a cross, having two  magnificent Altars. I asked permission to sketch this  fine church from the little plaza front, but was  told that it could not be granted, without a  special permit. I then proceeded to sketch theyards, with numbered cells, in which from 10 to 30 may sleep on a brick pavement, having their own blankets of course. There is usually a cook shop in one of these cells, called a \"Fonda,\" where coffee, meat &c. are prepared to order, and usually well charged for; although the cooking may be very inferior to any thing in the States. In chocolate, however, the Mexicans excel, and sometimes in coffee, and especially in light sweet cakes. March  25th.  (Sunday)  Our company (of between 40 and 50,)  Left San Louis Potosi this morning at half past five, in double file presenting to the gazing crowds quite a military face, as red flannel was very conspicuous on almost every man, for almost every coat was off, it being clear moderately warm, and very dusty for a time. In the distance the city appeared beautiful and interesting. We soon entered upon open and barren rolling hills, where I found several handsome specimens of agate scattered among gravel. I neither heard of, or saw any of the silver mines of this State, though I believe them to exist in Durango, Zacatecas, and the state of San Louis Potosi, as large silver trains pass down to Tampico from this country, every few weeks. [*38A*]about 10 miles from San Louis, we entered upon some very rocky hills, into deep ravines, several narrow vallies and through narrow passes, with a cross here and there at short intervals, marking the spot where some traveller has been murdered, and his remains, if poor, deposited beneath. Our company was composed of over 40 American two Spanish guides, 8 Arrearos' or mule drivers, (Mexican) and 14 pack mules to carry our baggage allowing 150lbs. to each mule in order to travel with speed and safety. Our guns, pistols, swords, knives, &c. were all ready for immediate use, and were kept in excellent order, and many of our boys made the vallies echo with their jovial songs whilst passing, at the same time keeping an eye for any vagrant Guerrillas among the cliffs and brushes. One of the narrow vallies through which we passed during this day was peculiarly romantic, whilst a broad creek filling nearly the width of this valley of precipices, meandered with it; the bed of this creek, was in most places almost dry, so that we travelled some miles upon beds of gravel. At one place, on passing up the side of a precipitous, volcanic hill, I saw a very great quantity of handsome Geods of Calcedony, scatteredchief plaza looking eastward, including the fountain The Parroquia, a fine church, and a small part of   St Domingo east of it. A crowd of idle male and female spectators soon assembled around me bobbing continually their ugly phiz's directly in my face, so as interrupt, and intercept the view I was sketching -- presently two officers in military uniform, arrested me, and proceedded with me to an Alcalde's office, at the left base of the Governors' Palace. He wished to know  if I had a permit to sketch, I informed him that I had from the Praefectas' Clerk; upon which he discharged me and sent an officer (in uniform) to accompany me to my former seat on the Plaza, who stood by me with drawn sword, and like a gallant man kept men, women, and boys, at full bey, until I had finished my task, when he left me with a polite bow, &c. No 30, represents that sketch on the chief plaza. This plaza is almost always densely crowded by  all grades and classes of people, who stare as much as Americans, as though they were Bedouin Arabs; No 31. is a red sand stone fountain, which I sketched in the Southern port of the city at the head of the Allamo                                           walk before described.It is much of the time crowded by visitors for water, No 32. is the chief market plaza; upon this plaza are numerous Doric pillars, well finished from red sand rock, it is intended in time to place a roof upon them so as to shelter the market to be held therein. This view is looking north, at the present time the markets are held around the principal building. A good cup of coffee can be had here for a Mordeau 6 1/4 ct and mellons with many other things proportionably cheap. At this date 25th March, water mellons &c. are plentiful and cheap; the markets appeared flush with delicious fruits, oranges, mellons, cantelopes, bannannas, &c. etc; but no apples or peaches; no walnuts, chesnuts, or hickory nuts, yet similar though better than the market of Tampico. The scenery about San Louis Potosi is in places romantic and interesting when combined with the distant mountain scenery of the Southwest; the contrast of mud huts with splendid edifices and the superb residences of the wealthy are very striking and is the first thing to be observed by every traveller. At this place, they are decidedly hostile to theAmericans, partly I presume from the late war and in part from religious education. At evening the  Host, or priests, pass around in a fine carriage, drawn by mules; before which a number are seen walking, each carrying his candle, whilst several small bells, are tinkling to the heavy toll of deep tone'd bells of the Sanctuary every person male, female, young & old, must Kneel to  the host whilst passing This is a strict religious  ceremony, the nonobservance of which brings at once  upon the head of the disobedient immediate dangers  either in being stoned, or possibly something worse,  besides inculcating the ill will of the observers. In  San Louis, though there are English, French, and  some Americans, yet they are much more strict  in Religious observances than in Tampico, and  Americans should be more on their guard in  passing into the interior of Mexico and westward. As near as I could ascertain, the population of  San Louis Potosi, is about 75 thousand. The proportion of which are illitterate Mexicans of the Indian  race, called Mexican Indians. They are usually clothed  indifferently, live similar in mud huts, upon mud  floors, andlead a servile life, or one of complete indolence. Our Company remained 3 days in San Louis in order to purchase some fresh Animals, shoe others, and prepare for our further progress to Mazatlan. The two divisions with others joined in order to leave Potosi together, so as to make a display of arms, as we were informed that 70 armed guerrillas had preceeded us to the mountain passes in order to rob us, as it was currently reported here that we were in posession of a large amount of gold, and going to California to remain. It is well known that a large population of robbers live in San Louis Potosi, whose chief business is to watch and rob travellers, which makes robberies every day affairs in this country. The Mexican Indian population of this part of the Republic, seeing the monopolies of the government, have rebelled and endeavored to first down the present government with that pretext, and at the same time committing gross outrages and robberies under that cloak, by themselves. I am not aware of any Hotel in the American style existing in the whole city of San Louis, Masons or public houses exist there, which consists of squarefor at least a half mile upon the pass, No 33. is a hasty sketch taken offhand in passing a part of this interesting valley, having a large gravel bed in the foreground No 34. is a sketch of curious mountain looking west, from the summet of a gently sloping prairie hill, after having ascended from the narrow passes, and large hills on the east to this much more elevated country. In the afternoon we came upon an extensive open prairie with a gentle slope of miles, without timber and covered with parched grass, so that there was no shade, with an abundance of dust flying in considerable clouds. Several times during the day, Mexicans, richly dressed, and well mounted upon firey steeds, would ride into our ranks, bow politely, talk for a time, and then disappear, we judged them to be the guerrilla spies, and took good care to show them our determination and strength of arms. Just before sunset we arrived at the Hacienda of Tepetate, the proprietor being hostile to the Americans, would not permit us to occupy the Mason, so that we were compelled to camp out not withstanding the night proved to be very cold; we raised our camp fires, and soon prepared excellent though plain suppers, which took their usual round in messes. A strict guard was set, and the1849. March. night passed off without molestation, although anticipated before sunset I took sketch No 35 of Tepetate Hacienda. (Monday)  26th  Day clear and warm. Commenced March this morning at 6. O clock. The scenery ahead was extensive, pretty, and interesting. Several of our men were on the  sick list to day, but nothing very serious, except one man who had his arm broken some days back of San Louis Potosi, but he is now rapidly improving. Our journey today extended 18 leagues, the same as yesterday and one horse lost on this days' march, on every day event with the numerous trains on this route to Gaudalaxara. During the day we passed over a hilly country and  then upon a gently rolling country covered with immense fields of wild cactus, prickly pears, and other thorny plants usually from 5 to 10 feet in height, and often extending thus as far as the eye could reach, without any relief of other plants, &c. I found some pretty specimens of Chalcedony by the way. At evening we arrived at the Hacienda of Novelia, about 100 miles from Potosi. A pretty green valley was spread out on the right, and a similar valley to the left, whilst we descended upon the rocky side of the hill as inNo. 36 into the right hand valley facing the southwest, we camped again in front of a Mason, and they were still hostile towards us. At night a cloud dark as Egypt rol'd o'er us from the North West, with a short but heavy shower, accompanied with heavy thunder and lightning. Our baggage escaped by being carried under shelter, and we passed a very uncomfortable night. About eleven at night when darkness reigned in blackness, a noise like stampeeding or stealing  our horses and mules took place. 7 or 8 of our party immediately proceeded to search for the intruders with loaded arms, but found none there except our mule drivers; An hour after some alarm was created by hearing about 40, reports similar to the firing of guns in quick succession over in the next valley; we were however ready for any guerrillas or other intruders, but they did not trouble us further, as we fired salutes a number of times which echoed along the valley like sober precautions. [*Tuesday 27th*] Day clear and warm. Commenced our march at 6. O. clock, and crossed extensive open, dusty, and hot prarie plains. By eight in the morning the Sun generally gets warm and quite hot by nine, which continues until the customary evening breeze springs up from 12 to 5. O. clock.About noon we passed a romantic village where I sketched the church in No 37. but did not think to learn the name of the village as I was much in the rear when I drew it, besides being attacked by a noisy pack of wolfish dogs. To day we began to find plenty of palatable fruit upon the prickley pear plants that were very abundant on our way; which became more ripened as we advanced. We passed around the base of a lofty and barren rocky mountain into a magnificent valley, where could be seen many handsome Haciendos, ranches little lakes walled up, with strong stone breastwork, extensive fields under good cultivation, some of which were irigated by fresh running streams, woodlands, a small meandering river, orange-groves, and other marks of civilization, besides another long and very beautiful village, along a broad and shady road, very unlike what we had seen since leaving San Louis Potosi. It was really an extensive or far reaching valley of civilization handsome ranches, and a garden spot, among the barren praries and mountains of Central Mexico. Rabbits (with long ears and) of uncommon size, were very plentiful, 7 and 8 have been started at a time, of course we made some fine meals from them; A fine fresh breeze blows yet each afternoon from the Gulf of Mexico but in a few more days we are told that it will blow from the Pacific Ocean, towards the east each afternoon at the same time though opposite to that from the Gulf of Mexico. Before Sun set we landed at a rancho called \"San Nicholas\" a dilapidated rancho unlike much of this fine valley which I sketched as in Number 38. here some of our party were in to bathe, though the water was cold, being considerably elevated; water mellons, eggs, &c. were abundant and cheap, and the mellons of excellent quality. Notwithstanding we might here occupy rooms in a  Mason, yet most of our party preferred sleeping out in the open air, although it was somewhat cool at night. At this place there is a small church, which from the peculiarly rude paintings of Deer &c upon it, I would judge to be very ancient among modern things; it has however a flat roof, which is the customary Mexican fashion of building, except where they have become partially Americanized.Wedned. 28th. Day clear and warm. Commenced our march at 6. O. clock for a short days travel of only 15 miles to the beautiful city of San Maria Del Lagos, which is located down the same handsome and fertile valley as before described. Our road was broad, well setled, and abounded with shade, water, and pretty scenery, whilst we were most of the time in full view of the two opposite mountain ranges of barrenness on each side of this pleasant valley of groves and gardens. We entered Lagos city, over a small but handsome stone bridge, by a broad road, quite equal to some of our American McAdamized roads, and of very pretty and romantic scenery. We entered in double file with the pack mules ahead as usual, and presented quite a line of a military face, as each had his coat off, exhibiting uniformly red flannels, and plenty of well kept arms. Multitudes gazed upon us with apparently great surprise and curiosity, to which we have now become accostomed. After winding about for some time along the various streets, &c, we at last came to quarters in the \"Mason De Merce.\" Crowds soon surrounded our wide spreading archway,to sell us mellons, oranges, sweetmeats, etc. &c. In company  with a friend I visited the Market plaza, where I  purchased a fine cantelope for a Quartelia a 3 ct. piece,  a bowl of buttermilk for a Tolacco, 1 1/2 ct. piece. A good  water mellon for a Quartee, 3 cts. a box of excellent  preserves for a Tolacco, 1 cent and a half, and a good  bowl of coffee for a Madeau or 6 1/4 cts. This is the  only place where I ever saw Ice cream for sale. A number of delicious fruits crowded this market, that  we never see in the States, some of which we found  wild along our road. Near the Market there is a  fine large public plaza, well built up with stones  of the first class, with shade trees, many good seats,  and a handsome fountain in the centre. On the North  side of this plaza there stands one among the most  noble and massive Sanctuaries of Mexico, and usually  ranked among her chief churches, which I  endeavored to sketch as in No. 39. it is build of a hard  light red sand stone approaching a cream color; I did  not obtain its dimensions, but it is certainly larger than  any church which I have ever seen in the States, and  in workmanship equal to the finest church of New York.It rises in Lagos like an immense collosal pile, a great monument of perseverance and skill,. It has been erected about 40 years, and towers above the city like St Peters' at Rome. The interior is still more splendid than its exterior, gorgeous displays of wealth, immense gothic works in gold and  silver leaf, are suspended from the far off ceiling, an organ, richly decorated is supported by a beautiful and curiously formed gallery, Pilasters of great height trimmed with silver leaf, rise between and separate very large and brilliant paintings. Statues, here and there decorated with costly dresses, gems, &c occupy their several positions whilst the chief  Altar is a piece of work of great expense and  magnificense, [whilst] and a high arching dome throws its many color'd lights down upon the rich counter colors of the chief Altar, and gives to the whole a peculiarly beautiful appearance. Bells of great magnitude (originally from Spain) toll at various hours of the day in concert with the other church bells of the city. By permission I ascended the only tower in which the great bells are suspended, andfrom that massive stone cupola, I sketched scene No 40.  looking south west over a portion of that fertile  valley before described, and a part of the city of Lagos,  including several fine churches, and the nunnery &c, showing two important table mountains in the distance, the present bed of the river, which is now nearly dry, and the flat rooves of the city; with a small part of the public plaza. This is the most interesting section for a view out of four, as it comprehends only about 1/4th of the city, and time would not permit me to sketch any others in this interesting city. The delay of a half day at Lagos was occasioned by our horses and mules requiring some improvements in shoeing, thus affording me a short period for sketching. This town includes about 12 thousand inhabitants, and is apparently a thrifty and stirring place of considerable neatness and beauty, though in places antiquated. This afternoon at 2.O.clock, a party of 7 Americans and 5 Frenchmen arrived here from Verra Cruz, and the city of Mexico. They met with troubles and dangers by the way, and were very glad to join in with our company in going to Mazatlan, which a part of them did in dangerous times.[*Thorsd 29th*] Day clear and warm. Commenced our march this morning at 6.O.clock, for the beautiful city of \"San Juan Del Lagos,\" a place of about 7 thousand inhabitants, and about 12 leagues distant from the former. More than half the days march was over a dry and barren country. We approached within a very short distance of the town, before discovering it, as it was  situated in a narrow and very deep valley, and hardly discovered until we had got nearly over it, when we descended a paved road directly into the city of life, and dense crowds of curious spectators. The scenery of this deep and narrow valley, with its meandering  water course, and the distant mountains, was peculiarly  barren and wild; but the town had pleasant orange groves, gardens, &c, with shady walks and fountains here and there and a very handsome plaza, upon which  was the largest and finest Sanctuary we had yet seen even surpassing in magnitude the one last seen,  this was indeed a stupendeous pile of human art and perseverance; a sign informed us that its age exceeded 100, years, and it was yet in an excellent state of preservation. In front of this grand Sanctuary therewas a handsome fountain in the centre of a public plaza, surrounded by seats and in a circle of small Allamo trees. Most of the houses were highly ornamented with various colored devices, whilst rows of massive collonades, made the plaza scene quite agreeable, which was very much crowded by the inhabitants, and the market plaza was in its immediate vicinity. No. 41 is a sketch of the grand Sanctuary of \"San Juan Del Lagos.\" in magnitude and external beauty it exceeds the other at San Maria  Del Lagos, but in its interior magnificense it is about the same though still more expansive. The floor of the interior is inlaid with porcelain of China of various colors of chequered work; and the same upon the outer surface of the great dome. The workmanship of the steeples (which are very high) is considered inferior to none in all Mexico, certainly I never before saw any similar work equal to them, either in Mexico, Canada or the States. Time would scarcely permit a careful sketch of this massive edifice, and night closed upon me without my being able to get others from other positions, of fountains, churches, and a view of the city &c. As our party left early next morning no time of course was available for further sketches.[*Fridy. 30th*] Day clear and warm, Commenced our march at half past six O.clock, crossing a large and costly stone bridge, the handsomest and largest I had yet seen in Mexico; it was handsome and built entirely of a light hard free stone; toll was paid in crossing it. a paved road wound around and up the hill in a serpentine form until it reached the summet, from which there was a splendid view of the town, river, churches, groves, &c; we passed from this pleasant view into another very steep, deep, and narrow valley; from which we arose again to follow a rolling barren country of prarie hills, covered here and there with fragments of loose broken rocks, and much broken chalcedony. An Alcalde with Lady, &c. has accompanied our train for several days, keeping near us, and travelling in a regular Mexican carriage drawn by 6 mules, four of which travel abreast, with a driver sitting upon one of them, the whole affair appeared clumsy. He usually stopped at the same Masons with our company; he was evidently travelling under our  protection from Ladrones or robbers, as the Mail and several Mexican gentlemen were then dooing.about 9.O. clock this morning a body of 3 or 4 hundred Mexican soldiers passed us, followed by many women and children, the whole of whoom were on foot except their officers. At the head of one of their companies was an Irish Deserter who addressed us in the usual language of contempt whilst a number of the soldiers spoke to us in Spanish and a little in the English. They were bound for Rio Verdy, a town of importance towards Tampico, in order to put down Queros and his party, who were opposed to the Government of Herrara. During the after part of this day we passed over an extensive country of open rolling and barren praries, exhibiting scarcely any thing else but rocks, gullies, parched grass and in places an abundance of dust. At evening we landed at an old dilapidated rancho, where provisions were scarce and dear; the name of this rancho was \"Lavent,\" which I sketched and No 42, at sunset. [*Sat. 31st*] Day clear and warm. Commenced our march this morning at half past six O. clock, having only 7 leagues for the day For the first time, we now passed through a valley of gentle undulations, having a very red soil, that  was under cultivation, and appearing to be productive, along the valley there was about a half mile to the right,a high hill appearing very much like an old dilapidated pyramid, which was the opinion of several who saw it. During this mornings march, we passed through several small villages of scattering mud cabins, inhabited as usual by Mexican Indians. About 1.O.clock we descended a paved road into a broad ravine, and after crossing a bridge ascended upon the side of a low spreading hill into the town of Tepatillan, where we remained until the following morning as it was too far to the next rancho for the day. Before night [nigh], I sketched the church as in No. 43. the age of which is nearly a century and a half. It is a plain building, very large, and of an Antiquated appearance. This town contains about 6 thousand inhabitants; having a neat and pleasant appearance about the plaza, and chief streets. The walks of the plaza are all followed by ranges of very large and spreading shade trees resembling the Oak though more expansive. In the centre of this plaza there is a handsome fountain, and on the South Side of it, the town market, and opposite under a long colonade where the Alcalde's office was located. A young man from the States, was arrested [here] by some Frenchmen andimprisoned here on a charge of stealing two hundred  dollars, which he protested against strongly. Most of  our company visited him, and by much taking with  the Alcalde had him taken from a miserable cell  of crowded polution, and placed in better quarters,  we could not get him released, and had to leave him  at the mercy of his enraged enemies, and the Alcalde  believing him to be innocent of that charge, although  he frankly acknowledged having stolen 60 dollars  in Mexico, whilst in distress. Upon which acknowledgement  the Alcalde made out his commitment. The  Frenchmen (we were afterward told.) Said they would  wait until the Americans had left, when by some  means they would get him out, and kill him in the  mountains. The whole appeared like a sad affair. I felt sorry for the young man for we could not  render him assistance without endangering our own  liberty. The feelings of the whole American Company  were against the Frenchmen, who treated him with  severe abuse. He was a delicate young man of about 20.  and said that he had left a widow'd mother and a  sister in the States, and he pointed to a ring on hisfinger, and said that this was the only token of theirs now in his possession, and that at night in his cell, the Mexicans had wrench'd his finger repeatedly to get it. If he escapes, it will be by some miracle unknown to wiley Frenchmen, and stupid Mexicans. This evening the host passed around the plaza drawn in his superb carriage, with the usual ceremonies. April Sund 1st Day clear and warm. Commenced our march at an early hour. The first part of the day we passed over a rolling and barren woodless country, with mountains in the distance. In the afternoon we descended into a lower country a large valley extending many miles and somewhat of a triangular  form as in No 44. In this valley a stream meandered along which in places woodlands appeared. At one place on a low and spreading hill, beside this stream, was located a very romantic and beautiful little town, the admiration of all our company. It appeared to be one forest of very tall orange trees, with bushels beside bushels laying thickly strewn upon the ground in almost every direction with small and neat cabins scattered here and there through these extensive groves. Most of the orange trees  were over 20 feet in height, much resembling largeapple orchards. Among the rest of the pleasant things to be observed here, was a cool and refreshing mountain spring of considerable size rushing rapidly in various branches down the quick descents of several of its streets. Shaded by palms, cactus, orange groves and shrubbery, We passed in sight of the plaza; where I saw a neat looking church. About 4 or 5 miles from this village we passed through another, less shaded, beside the same stream, and near a fair looking stone bridge. Still continuing in this long valley, just before sunset, we came to a river of good size, and descending a long slope lined on either side with Mexican cabins, from a  large mason on the hill, down upon a very large and antiquated stone bridge, upon which were four square towers, upon two of which were statues of the King and Queen of Spain, with an inscription beneath nearly obliterated by time, upon the other two towers were statues of monks or fathers. we crossed this large bridge and put up at a mason on the opposite side in the little town of Tolololotlan, after passing up a street of cabins of more than a mile in length, we found our Mason. I then proceeded in company down to thebeautiful banks of the Rio Grande or San Antonio, and sketched  the great bridge as in No 45, looking north from  above on the west bank of this interesting stream. On the opposite or North side of the bridge of  Tolololotlan, the whole river pitches over large  masses of rocky boulders with a heavy lumbering  roar that can be heard for several miles before  reaching it; above it spreads out to a considerable  width dotted here and there promiscuously with  small and interesting islands, with green meadows  rolling hills, and the lofty blue mountains, all of which  forms a highly picturesque scene, which I endeavored  to sketch as in No 46. On first beholding this fine  little river, it may naturally be supposed that we  rejoiced at the first sight of a stream that emptied  into the great Pacific Ocean, and it seem'd to make  us feel that a part of our great journey to California  via Mexico would soon draw the land chapters  to a grateful close. On the following morning by early light  I sketched a part of the interior of our Mason as in sketch 47.  where the earthen flower jars were plentifully ranged  around the tops of our mason columns, containing  shrubs &c.1849. April. At this place we fell in company with a small New York party  of 8 or 10 persons, and learned from them, that one of  their party had been shot in the head by accident and  killed instantly, it happened at a bridge not far from this  place; the father of the deceased was present in the same company. Mond 2nd Day clear and warm. Commenced our march at 6.O.clock for 8 leagues. Passed through a small cove, and then upon a high plane  where there was a considerable pond or small lake, and  afterwards crossed a deep ravine upon a stone bridge by a  small village, a place noted for robberies &c. and from thence  proceeded over a hilly and picturesque prarie country until  we ascended a considerable ridge, in company with a very  large burthen train of miles for the great city just ahead. On descending this slope into a somewhat lower country  a distant view of Gaudalaxhara, broke upon us as in  sketch 47. which I hastily copied by the way, being then  within about 6 miles of the city and looking North west. Before arriving at Gaudalaxhara, at 4 miles distant, we  passed through a small town of a very pleasant appearance  in which there was the remains of a once superb sanctuary. A handsome shaded plaza with a curious fountain,  and a tall and handsome dragon fountain at the North west  suburbs of the town,on this plaza sweet meats, lemonade, and other  mild drinks with Polka, a drink sweeter than cider, with oranges, mellons, bannannas, and other fruits were very abundant and cheap. the exhibition of which presented quite a pretty appearance as they were promiscuously ranged about the fountain plaza beneath the broad spreading shade trees. From the suburbs of this town to the suburbs of Gaudalaxhora, there is a broad Mc Adamized road 3 miles in length, with 4 rows of spreading shade trees, principally of the Allamo with others of very great magnitude, as in sketch  No 48. extending its whole length, thus dividing two pleasant and shady walks on both sides of the principal road, which was about 50 feet in width, about 100 feet including each walk, this road with its neighboring scenery and a distant inkling of the city presented quite a pretty and interesting appearance. We entered the city in double file, with pack mules in the advance. The suburbs appeared very extensive, and it was at least one hour before we reached our Mason, as we seem'dGaudalaxhara. continually winding hither and thither, among a continuous crowd of strange brown faces and peculiar scenes. Having arrived in one of the handsomest and greatest cities of all Mexico, I hastened to avail myself of every opportunity to explore and discover its fine arts &c. In entering we passed 4 or 5 very handsome public edifices but time would not permit me to sketch them except in a  general view. an aqueduct of water, at first mistaken for a regular canal with stone bridges, abutments and its handsomely finished breast works crosses the southern part of the city proper, along it there are shady walks of trees great Magnitude and age, with fountains in shady places,  and fruit plazas in various directions; watermellons were vastly abundant, and cheap, piles of them were seen on almost every little plaza, where any fruit might be sold. As near as I could ascertain the population of Gaudalaxhara, was about One hundred and seventy five thousand which I believe is about the correct estimate, as it appears much larger than Baltimore, M.D. April. Tuesd 3rd Day warm & clear. Our company concluded to remain in this fine city over this day to proceed early on the morrow. Of course I saw and sketched as much as possible. [*31*]The city is very regularly laid out in right angle streets, usually from 20 to 40 feet in width public gardens and several fine plazas, besides market squares variously. It is considered more than twice as large as San Louis Potosi, and the most beautiful of all the cities of this Republic, and second only to the city of Mexico in size. It is located in an interesting valley, and surrounded by barren mountains in the distance, and elevated several thousand feet above the level of the Ocean. A part of the valley about it is under very good cultivation and presents an extensive and civilized appearance. Every thing combined with a pleasant breezy afternoon, such as we had on entering Gaualaxhara, - a prettier scene could scarcely be found in any of the Northern States of Mexico. It is much admired and spoken of by all travelers who have visited it. Its communications with other towns is conducted entirely by mules, and horses, and all goods carried upon the pack saddles of mules. So that the main roads leading each way from the city, is almost constantly crowded for miles beyond the reach of the eye, with thousands of horsemen, and pack mules, going and returning in large companies.Near this city such scenes are really so animating that it would seem almost incredible were the number at one single view given. Dust is of course very plentiful During this day I visited many parts of the city, the interior of several splendid churches, public buildings, gardens, cemetaries &c. The main plaza, is the most splendid of all that I have yet seen in (all of) Mexico, and said to be handsomer than that of the city of Mexico. It is in the form of a square, followed by Allamo shade trees upon each side, with neat seats, and a handsome fountain in the center. The buildings which surround it are of the first class, and bear much resemblance to all the old Spanish edifices of Spain. The streets which Surround it, for nearly a mile in every direction, exhibit great displays of wealth, fashion, business, and refinement. There is a custom much used here, of covering the pavements with long and massive collonades of one and occasionally two stories in height. Almost every house, building, or edifice, excepting the finest sanctuaries, have the usual flat rooves, and generally a very massive appearance, somewhat similar to Egyptian customs. [*52*]Here strange scenes and strange brown faces, that - densely throng the plazas, markets, groves, [and] fountains, and beneath the long and massive colonnades, makes the American feel at once his absence from home, and his isolated position among the most strange of foreign countries. Strange customs, ceremonies, dress, and modes of living seems to transplanted you at once into another and different world. Go where you will, you are a stranger, and a strange object of gaping curiosity, even to the Soldiers in the Official Pallaces, who would treat you respectfully with small presents of fruits, and politeness, and permit you to intrude on forbidden ground, whilst a common mexican for the same intrusion without a permit, might find a sharp whack upon his callabash the consequence. Among the litterati and official circles of this city there is certainly less hostility to the Americans, than among the illitterate, half Indian, and Servile population, and those on the way back to San Louis Potosi. On the main plaza, there stands an immense Sanctuary of great dimensions and magnificense: It occupies asquare of itself including a grand wing called the Cathedral, as in No. 49. The chief building under the larger dome being called the Sagrario, all of which is now being repaired and repainted with superb interior displays. It is the grand Sanctuary of this city and among its finest buildings for interior displays, which are immensely grand and very elegant; gems, Saints in splendid attire, magnificent Altars, Organs, paintings, large immages apparently cast in gold, over the Altars, inlaid porcelain, work, stained glass of various  colors, beautiful silken draperies, massive silver ornaments, gothic columns, and gothic domes gilt with gold and silver leaf, until the whole glittered by the evening lights like some fabulous golden palace for beings above the common things of mortality. No such scenes of granduer can yet be found in the States, and I have been repeatedly surprised at the enormous wealth, which must have been lavished upon these religious pallaces in Mexico. judging from the time, and immense labor required in their completion; and in their superior pieces of Sculpture, Architecture, and paintings, with their mammoth bells, and [*53*]fine toned Organs, superior castings, elegant designs, drapery, massive granduer, orders of Architecture, and fine materials, which at this day, far exceeds the small and half civilized capacities of the original Mexican inhabitants. From Spain all this display of wealth, &c has originated, been cast, planed, carved, painted, and then transplanted upon the planes, vallies, and mountains of Mexico, and there set up profusely all over the land in immense colosal monuments, whilst Mexico was under that Government. From this beautiful plaza I proceeded towards the aquaduct Southward, where getting upon the flat top of a Mexican Mason or public house, I sketched scene No 50. looking North East, towards some of the mountain ranges, and over the prettiest part of Gaudalaxhara, which I selected from the four views, showing a part of the aquaduct a fine large church, a part of the Hospital in the distance and a fine long park. The principal part of the city rises upon a broad and gentle undulation to the left of this aqueduct, the face of which is dotted here and there with handsomepublic edifices as in this view (No. 50). I then  proceeded to a fine public garden about a mile  from this location, in which I took sketch No. 51. I suppose that it covered about 8 acres, being larger  than any of the squares of Philada. In the centre  of it there was a large fountain, from which fine  walks passed off in each direction. Shade trees  of great magnitude covered the square, whilst the beds were full of beautiful shrubs in full  bloom, which on entering presented to us the appearance of a beautiful shady grove richly and  closely carpeted with many species of flowers  so ingeniously interwoven as to show the  figgure of one large flower by the shades of  those planted together. This I have seen  in many places through Mexico. In this garden  there was a fine large revolving swing with 4 seats,  similar to those in the States. This was a large and  very beautiful garden and appeared to be a place of fashionable  resort. From this place I proceeded towards  the aqueduct and sketched a curious fountain in  the long park as in No. 52. From this fountain [*54*]I proceeded about two miles to the northern suburbs,  and passing several beautiful churches of curious  Architecture, I came to a large enclosed Square, which  proved to be a cemetery; apparently of recent origin.  in the center of this square [was] I sketched No 53.  which is a handsomely ornamented and chequered frame with two interior apportuents which were  beautifully ornamented and richly decorated within  No 54 is a sketch of a beautiful freestone monument in the same enclosure. Directly facing No 53, and at  the opposite end of the same pavement I sketched  the grand collonade building as in No 55. each of those  square chambers along it are intended for two or more  coffins, the door of which being closed has upon the outer side the usual inscription of the tombstone. Day light prevented further sketches , though I would have taken many more if the opportunities would have  permitted. The market plazas were located in  several parts of the city, and were crowded to  excess with watermelons and other fruits. and on  one plaza exceeding any thing I had ever seen in  Mexico, and a most beautiful sight too, as everythingwas very tastefully arranged, even to the different colors of Lemonades, &c. Many fruits were abundant here that are never seen in the States.  most of which are sold at reasonable prices. After leaving the cold winter of the States and comming so suddenly into hot weather, dust, mellons, and oceans of fruit amid a Summer heat in Mexico  you may well suppose that we are quite sensible of this change; whilst we often remarked to each other, that our relatives at home little thought that we were now feasting upon the  finest mellons in the world, whilst the cold winds of winter were whistling around their homes. I doo not think that there are more churches here than in San Louis Potosi, notwithstanding this is so much longer than the former city of Potosi. I visited several fine churches, but had no  time to sketch even a small part of the great beauties I saw during even this one day. Though vehicles of any kind were seldom seen through  the country, yet heavy carriages of a clumsey - [*55*]   appearance for the aristocracy and the Priests were quite plentifull in townThe americans still continue to arrive in this city, 40 more during this day from Mexico. Wed 4th. Day clear and warm. Commenced our march at 6.O. clock. On leaving the city, we passed the walls of an extensive prison, which was being erected of stone, at the North Western suburbs. The road was broad, very much crowded, and almost one continued cloud of dust for many miles out of the city. About four miles on the way we passed a neat little village, with a magnificent Sanctuary or public edifice, therein of enormous dimensions and square walls enclosing some 8 or 10 acres, with very high (18 or 20 feet) iron railing in front which was ornamented and gilt, and ranging a full square between delicate pillars and light arches of stone. Some of our party supposed that it was the Bishop's Palace. About 12 miles from the city we passed a tall gate; it was a high stone gate crossing the road in one arch about 35 feet in height with a large Mason, and a few scattering huts about it. After this our road wound aroud large hills, deep ravines, through several narrow passes, and for the first time in a great distance, among numerous large pines, oak bushes, &c ranging over desolate looking hills.At about 20 miles from Gaudalaxhara, I made a hasty sketch  looking west as in No 56. showing the mountains and a small part of the lower valley country, which is somewhat below  the valley of the city we have just left. This is a celebrated  part of the country for Robberies, and we were even told in Gaudlaxhara, that two hundred, Ladrones or  Robbers had left that city the night before us, on our way  to cut us off at about 30 miles out. We did not however regard it, knowing the veracity of Mexican reports  which generally had some other crafty object in view. At about 22. or 23 miles from the city, we came upon an open prarie of rolling or undulating knolls, a part of which had them been recently burned off, on this black charry and dismal looking place, there stood  a large and high gallows, upon which were suspended  the bodies of three Robber chiefs; they had been suspended  there about 3 weeks, and were ghastly looking objects, bullet holes preforated their dried bodies in many  places which were nearly ready to drop to the earth.  over them was a large painted Sign, as follows -  \"Thus the Law punishes the Robber and the Assassin\". Only a few weeks before we arrived here these men [*56*]were chief actors in some bloody deeds, about this place, until some of the government troops overtook them with the justice they merited. The number of these Robbers are said to have been about 200 strong, committing  constant depridations and murders upon travellers and many of the regular Mexican baggage trains. This scene was to melancholy a picture to sketch, so that I left it for a more fit object and about 3. miles further west, as in sketch No 57. I copied a peculiar mountain and small village, to the right of which our road continued its torturous course. In the afternoon as we descended into a third interesting valley, our mountain scenery became extensive, very lofty, and peculiarly wild, moreso than we had yet seen them. Upon the right and upon the left were seen towering mountains, with immense barren cliffs above cliffs, and their numerous rugged woodless spears rising high in the air like collosal ruins of pyramids of yet untold of magnitude. To the west this great triangular valley tapered to our interesting focus, at the far point of which the sun was setting amid a few light and beautiful clouds.whilst the mountains diminished gradually as they receded in the background, all of which formed quite an intersting and beautiful landscape view though very wild. We then descended a hill into the lower valley, and took quarters for the night in a mason, beside the church on the market plaza of the town of Amattitan, being about 40 miles from Gaudalaxhara. Before dark I ascended a high precipice of rocks east of the market plaza, and sketched No 58. showing the square, the big walled spring facing the market, part of the church, part of the town of Amattitan, with its shade trees, with a part of the valley, and the mountains on the western horizon. Here we found plenty of mellons and other fruits all which were quite cheap. Our company here numbered over fifty. A part of them sat by moonlight under the broad archway of the gate of our mason, until 9. O. clock singing in concert, the national songs of America, some 60 or 70 Mexicans, crowded around them seemingly much delighted. About 9.O. clock a Mexican having stolen a purse, from Mr Hassan, was persued and shot at by him, which scattered the rest in short metre.The Alcalde, called next morning and commeded Mr Hassans' course, by saying that he wished Mr H. had killed the thief; it appears that he was wounded, but got off with the bead purse. We were informed at Gaudalaxhara, that this town was, and had been a celebrated rendezvous for the mountain Robbers. &c. [*Thurs'd. 5th*] Day warm and clear. Left Amattitan by early sun rise, and continued our march North west across the valley, among rolling hills of gentle slopes, having small rancho's here and there at short periods; this days road was peculiarly interesting in its scenery we saw to day many fields of the maguay plant ranging over many gentle hills, and upon some of the few fertile spots along the wild mountains base. They make a mild drink from it called  Polka, also the Ardiente, which is stronger than  whiskey, which I believe is made from the magauy also. About 11.O. clock A.M. we passed through Tekelah a town of some importance, noting perhaps 4000 inhabitants. It had a fine shady plaza, upon which stood a very large and antiquated church. On the plaza, fruit appeared in great abundance, andgoing through their usual ceremonies. fruits were abundant and 18, oranges were  bought here for a Madeau or 6 1/4 cts. Orange groves compose the  chief shade of the town. Several very large springs or rather small creeks, breakout of the hills east of the town square, and meander in rapid streams through several of the streets. The water was of a slightly milky cast, and an unpalatable limestone taste. At night the moon rose full and clear, with an occasional flitting cloud, and a gentle breeze. This night a band of 40 Mexicans, all [each] well armed with muskets, pistols, swords, and knives; - presented themselves in double file at the gate of our Mason, or Hotel; and demanded quarters there for the night. Our landlord believing them to be robbers told us to prepare our arms for service, which we did in a few minutes. The Landlord then told them through their captain, that his apartments were all full, and that they could not have quarters in his Mason, to which their captain answered that they would come in in defiance of him and those within. The gate of the Mason which was very broad, and of one expansive arch; the doors of which being open, the Robbers drew themselves up in a compact body immediately before it on the pavement and street. Our landlord stepping forward told them that they must wait a short time until he could see further about his accomodations. But he immediately passed out by another way from his Mason, in pursuit of the Alcalde of the town, who in a short time came with him to our quarters. The Alcalde enquired of their captain who they were, where from be. They answered that they were government soldiers; He then demanded of their captain, their passport as government soldiers, - but they could show none besides the said company acknowledged having travelled on two days, which by the laws of Mexico, no government troops, are permitted to travel. By their dress superabundance of arms, and statements the Alcalde judged them to be a band of ladrones or Robbers, following us, and not improbable that they were a detachment of a larger body, sent in town as government troops, in order to stop overnight in the walls of our Hotel to take us by surpriseand most probably after stealing our arms, then to attack the town, which is a common occurrence in many parts of Mexico. The Alcalde told us that he believed them to be Robbers. He evidently feared them. He told us to see that our arms were all in order and ready for execution in case we were attacked. Its a matter of course all our men were prompt in self defence, and with our guns, pistols, and knives, in hand and about us, we drew up in order, compactly before the door, facing the Robbers, who stood quietly facing and viewing us as mute as a posse of terrified owls; the Alcalde and our landlord refused them admittance into our Mason, but they would have entered by force had not our company presented a bolder front, headed by Capt Grant, of Philadelphia; who told them that they should not enter, except at the peril of their lives, at the same time every trigger was ready to tell. A moment of suspense, and they decamped in quick step up to the town plaxa, where they were permitted to stay by the authorities. After this the Alcalde came several times to ourquarters, telling us to put on extra guards, which we did, even upon the high walls, in order to stand sentinel over our horses as well as our other property, and persons. The Alcalde told us that there was a probability of either our company or the town being attack'd during the night, and wished us to promise that in case the town was attack'd by them, to assist the citizens and his little military force in putting down the Robbers, which we promised, and on the other hand he told us that if the attack should be directed first towards us, his people should assist us, but that we must not mistake and fire upon a religious procession of the citizens which would pass our Mason about 3 O. clock in the morning. This was an evening long to be remembered from many circumstances. It was a most beautiful moonlight night, and now and then a gentle breeze played fitfully from the beautiful lake of Madalena; My turn among the sentinels came from 12 to 2 O clock in the morning; and my positions around the high walls, and the expansive enclosed yards, was pleasant and romantic during so pleasant a night as this; seeming at times like a dream, that I were facing therounds of some ancient castle and looking down among the  dark shades of the groves around slumbering in silence beneath the full and magic moon. I stood upon the house top, meditating upon the beautiful Lake of Madalena, the mountains, standing off in deep shadows, the many flat rooves, the groves and the rocky cliffs near the town; about 2. O. clock a procession of the citizens took place; proceeding from the church and passed our Mason. It was headed by richly robed priests, who were chanting solemn airs; a full sized wax figure of our Savior, of full size, clothed in mourning with a crown of thorns, representing Him as passing up to Mount Calvary, whilst before Him were carried several hundred candles, with several hundred Mexican ladies following each with candles, accompanied with an excellent band of music, the whole was a peculiar scene. Before day light those Ladrones or Robbers before named had all disappeared, having preceeded us on our road through a formidable mountain and vastly grand ravine country, of deep cavernous valleys, suiting such a class of beings.1849 April 6th bay warm and clear. Commenced our march at  half past six o clock, winding our way around that beautiful and interesting lake of Madalena. Formidable mountains appeared in full view and an immense country of sugar loaf hills, sharp peaks, several hundred of which might be seen at one view from elevated positions, at times we passed over a graded road, upon which considerable pains had been taken, about 10 A.M. we descended into a very deep and curious valley of about two miles in width, passing down which it spread out to higher rolling hills with very deep chasms for water passing around these hills and amongst them variously. About 12  meridian I sketched Scene No 63 which was a large Hacienda, westward appeared very large mountains, between which and the Hacienda one several tortuous ravines, the deepest and most awfully grand that I ever saw, being more like immense caverns than ravines. through which we passed about 15 miles. They are called the \"Baranca's\". a road descends upon the  almost perpendicular face of one of them, which is very tortuous and romantic; as you might see the train quite beneath us.winding their way far down the deep cavernous  valley of the Baranca's; as in No 64. with high and  barren Mountains, sparcely timbered towering far above  these numerous deep Barancas. Passing along these  deep narrow vallies, we crossed several times a rapid  creek of some magnitude, over which in many places  high brown rocky cliffs, and various timbers,  bend gracefully over its romatic and noisy waters. No 65. is a sketch passing down the creek in this valley. No 66. do a short distance north west of the former sketch,   with high frowning bluffs of brown rocks. No 67. is another  passing father down the stream, where the road ascends  and again descends to the creek; after fording which  upon rocks [upon] from which the water was bounding  away rapidly; we ascended upon the opposite side,  where a small race of water descended to a pleasant  little dwelling, about which fine timber, several  species of very high cactus, and underbrush with luxuriant  grass were seen forming a highly picturesque  and romantic view. But our train passed so rapidly  that I was much in the rear with my last sketches,  and had to omit this pretty scene for one whichfollowed shortly after as in sketch no 68 where we came to  the junction of apparently three triangular vallies, or deep passes of the Barancas, and the junction of the two fine streams of fair water. At this place there was a pleasant Rancho over the creek, with little groves of oaks, pines, cactus, Bannannas, and beautiful green meadows. Our train turned round and up the left hand valley. And presently  came to scene as in No 69, very high, barren, and steep mountains of almost no timber, arose high in the air, with slight misty clouds around their summets; upon the side of one of them a road was seen ascending which is a view of a part of a graded road, cut over this great mountain by some foreigners at an immense cost, and in most places blown through the solid rock, and of excellent workmanship. In this little valley there was a mill of some kind in operation with a large horizontal wheel. I was afterwards told for the purpose of washing out the silver ore beneath the road, seen on the mountainside, there is a small and pleasant village, in which there is an abundance of fine fruits and surrounded by extensive green fields, meadows, groves, and fine timbers along the stream that meanders through its valley, that spreads  out to a ---triangular cove, dotted with several pleasant Rancho's, No 70. is a sketch taken on entering this pleasant cove where the village was located. After leaving the village we commenced ascending the mountain road. Time would not permit me to sketch as much as I desired, No 71. shows the workmanship on our fine road over, one of the most formidable mountains in Mexico, it is cut out of the rocks, and walled paved and graded thus all the way up this mountain for a distance of six miles. and as great a piece of work of its kind, as any that I know of in the U States of America. No 72. is another sketch farther up this fine road. The view from the Summet of this mountain looking eastward was fine indeed; including many a green and beautiful valley and more mountains, peaks, knolls, hills, vallies, dales, coves, and verdant spots, blended with wildness and prarie hills, than I had ever yet seen in all Mexico; and was really grand beyond description. The mountains far east about Gaudalaxhara could be seen like smoky shadows of deep blue mist. It is said that we have ascended to day, more than  7000 feet, above the deep Barancas through whichwe have just passed; and still a peak arises to our right, around which we wound our tortuous way looking over walls, that looked straight down upon abyss's that were quite beneath us thousands of feet. I found enough here for days of sketching, over which we passed rapidly as it was a region said to be well filled with Robbers, and frequent to many scenes of bloodshed, robbery, and other vile deeds; a few desperate men in these wild mountain passes could doo much harm even to a  large party. On the summit there is a rude breastwork evidently thrown up for that purpose. Cliffs of huge brown rocks here hang over frightful debths and thousands of deep ravines cut deep into and down the rugged mountain. This is our highest elevation  in crossing Mexico, we have gradually ascended 7000 feet to the Barancas, and about 7000 feet again to the summet of this grand dividing ridge of Mexico, making in all an elevation of about 14000 feet above the levil of the Sea. Upon this height we now have the afternoon winds from the Pacific Ocean; and from this forward to the Pacific each day, blowing uniformly from the west, and sometimes very strongly.We now commence our gradual descent toward the Pacific Ocean, an event of some interest to us of course; leaving the scenes east of the great Cordilleres, for those descending gradually into the mild and fertile vallies on the  great western side of this distinguished mountain. No 73. is a sketch of the first scene descending into  a beautiful and fertile valley, along which are plenty of Ranchos, several small villages, several sugar  mills, fine farms, meadows, groves, and plenty of small Mexican dwellings, shaded by Bannanas, Plantains, or perhaps the Allamo, or at times the spreading oak. A pleasant stream of water meandered along this  valley, the margin of which was thickly interwoven with brushwood, wildflowers, and followed by pleasant green meadows, which contrasted in a striking manner with the shadeless, and wild barren mountains; that were broken and rudely tossed into the high air as the fierce storms would toss the waters of the mighty ocean; and as rudely wild, and void of vegetation or timber in many places. This day we have made a march of 54 miles, and arrived at our Mason in the town of [Eastlan ?] a hour after sun set. It appeared to be a fine largetown; at sun set I sketched Eastlan at a distance of a few miles to the  east, being in advance of a part of our train, which during this day got much scattered on the way. There was a fine large Church in this town, with a large shaded plaza or public square, upon which there was a grand display of many  kinds of fruits, drinks &c. including watermellons, Oranges, Bannanas, &c. &c. with Lemonade; Polka, etc. A grand procession of the virgin Mary took place, this evening parading in large crowds the various streets of the town with hundreds of Ladies and Gentlemen each in procession, carrying their separate candles. The immage of the Virgin, was of full size, richly dressed in dark silks, and carried in a handsome Sedan; Other processions took place during  the evening; but I did not see all of them. This is a beautiful town of several thousand inhabitants; the houses are improving, are much neater, larger, and the people becoming much more refined and civilized than many of those before passed; Western Mexico, is well known to be the most refined and civilized portion of that country. We were much pleased with the decided improvement of whitewashing and other displays of taste in this place.No 74. is a hasty sketch of Eastlan and its surrounding mountains. The valley in which it is situated, descends gradually westward towards the Pacific Ocean; and is under good cultivation with pleasant Ranchos', several small villages &c. [*April 7th*] Day warm and clear; with an afternoon breeze from the  Pacific. Commenced our march at sun rise; and proceeded along the meanderings of a pleasant creek; that traversed this interesting valley. A few miles west of Eastlan we passed through a town of considerable size, within which there was a handsome shaded plaza, with a large, curious, and antiquated church. This town was also much shaded by Bannana and Orange groves and a greater part of the houses were very genteel. Here some of our company obtained excellent cups of chocolate &c. Many kinds of fruit were likewise abundant in this place. By the way, as we have before frequently seen, were erected several small shrines of some 8 or 10 feet square, in each of which was suspended the  cross, and around which were wreaths of roses, natural and artificial, with candles partly burned, and other things belonging to their religious ceremonies. These with lone cross's are to be seen plentifully throughoutMexico, and either mark a place of worship, or the spot where some individual has [been] met with an untimely  end. Proceeding down this pleasant valley and winding around various spurs of the wild mountains, that  rear'd their rugged heads upon either side of us, we at 15 miles from Eastlan opened upon a view as in No. 75, with the appearance of a volcano to the right hand. The creek that before travelled rapidly a rocky bed, now joined with other water courses in passing through a ravine or narrow channel of great debth. We now passed over immense fields of wildest volcanic rocks that at some period had been partly fused, and thrown up in rugged masses exceeding any description; extending thus for many miles west and North. The appearance of the rocks was quite black; in places quite spongy, and resembling somewhat the heavy spray of a wild Ocean storm, thrown up in massive peaks, and pinacles, that were at  once suddenly petrified or cooled into black rocky masses of half fused granite &c. Such a field of forrest peaks and black [Schorae ?], I have never before witnessed. The government of Mexico, have cut and paved a road through this lava country at great expense, labor and time.The particulars of which they have taken care to place  upon a pedestial by the way side; whereas by passing the road (such as it was) around a few miles to the left  they might have avoided the worst peaks and ridges  of the [Schorae ?]. Some scrubb oaks high pentangular cactus,  Etc shaded the Lava road in places, until we came out upon  barren hills. No 76 shows a hasty sketch of a part of the  lava fields on our way, looking back Southeast. About  this valley, which have spread out to many miles,  many little Ranchos and villages were to be seen upon  the fertile spots, like favored places upon the  desert of Arabia. The mountains around were exceedingly  wild, and only a few of them even sparsely timbered by a  dwarfish growth, of scrubb oaks, pines, and wild cactus. This broad triangular cove or great valley, was traversed  in every direction by hills, between which were small and  fertile coves, passes, and ravines, along which only the villages  and Ranchos were located. During this afternoon we passed through several pretty villages, that were snugly hid  away in these little vallies, and after passing over   a number of rolling hills, we ascended a mountain  to the north, where we encamped at Rancho Ocott.a few hundred yards from this rancho I sketched scene No 77. looking back Southward upon that great valley of vallies, over which we had just passed; from a height of about two thousand feet. I then passed on up the road 2 miles with a friend, and from a height looking into a vast ravine of perhaps 8 or 10 hundred feet, I sketched scene No 78. looking South west. Showing two great mountains rising in a part of the valley before named; a large stream of water was leaping and bounding off from cliff to cliff down this immense ravine, the sound of which could be heard a considerable distance; whilst it was closely shaded by tall timbers, that rose up the steep sides of the abyss, near to its summet edge. During this day we have seen back in the valley several fine falls of water from 5 to 60 or 70 feet, very suitable for mills but not improved. Along this deep ravine there are fine locations for such purposes. From this place Northward the timber for many miles became very large and plentiful; with large Oaks and pines in particular. During this afternoon Mr Slaight and Mr Jones two of our company were misled upon the wrong track, which caused some fears as to their safety, but both came into camp just  before dark.It is highly important that companies should keep compact whilst crossing the Mountains of Mexico, as those who stray off, are liable to be cut off by those who constantly watch such opportunities in the  trail of the large parties who may cross their country  April 8th  Day warm and clear. During this night individuals well known, left our camp by night, and proceeded forward at full speed, 16 leagues to Tepec, in advance of our train, in order to Secure passage up to california for themselves exclusive of our company should there not be room for all. This was showing their nature horns and all, for which they afterwards doubtless sorely repented, as certain of them had before promised to remain by each other through to California. The remainder of our company proceeded as usual not at all pleased with the rush for passage, almost every Mexican  returning; when asked, gave us different reports about the chances of passenger from San Blass up to San Francisco; and we could ascertain nothing very definite and but little that was encouraging. Some telling us that there was but one vessel in port which could take but four or five more passengers and prices very high, with poor accommodations; others,that there were several vessels in port, and others that there were none that could carry more passengers, and thus the reports varied, but the remainder of us thought best to take things coolly and as they might come; which afterwards proved to be to our especial advantage at Mazatlan. Proceeding northward on the Summet of the mountain on  which we had just encamped, we passed through much large and valuable oak timber. During the morning, I  sketched No 79. which includes Norelio Mountain, as seen  at the distance of about 10 miles to the northward, being also within full view of the town of Tepec to which we were bound. About an hour after sketching the former, we commenced descending a graded road down the mountain,  a part of which I sketched as in No 80. after which we  crossed a fine creek, then passed over and around a number of wild hills with but few scattering habitations, and those of the poorest kind until we came out upon the open woodless hills, that were beautifully rounded and moulded as by art, and only covered by parched prairie grass, and  ranging thus at random around the base of the great Novelio Mountain, whilst sloping off gently in an extensive valley, which was walled in on the North, East, and South by formidable mountains.Again, we ascended a small ridge, which soon gave us a fine view of the great valley of Tepec. We continued descending for Some time upon rolling hills, very sparcely timber with here and there patches of Scrubb oaks, cactus, etc. within about 6 miles of Tepec. I took sketch No. 81. [showing] showing the appearance of the country around that beautiful town. And before entering the town within about a mile and a half I took sketch No 82. showing a fine Stonebridge plastered, and of neat construction; on the principal road to Tepec. This road is generally broad, though not agreeable for [?] vehicles of any kind and is likewise well supplied with fine dust, which during (this) the dry season is almost intolerable during a windy afternoon. Our company arrived in Tepec at 3.O. clock. P.M. a band of dusty travellers, with long beards, jaded, and all the usual et ceteras that attend such a long journey and more especially in Mexico, but not yet closing our journey through this peculiar country. On arriving we ascertained that those preceding us to Tepec had engaged passage up to San Francisco upon a schooner of about 30 tons, that was said to be unfit for service. They paying 70 dollars, and find themselvesbesides being compelled to sleep upon deck; and even at that thinking themselves lucky in getting the chance, at the same time chuckling at us, whoom they considered unfortunate; in not having a chance to sail from San Blass, and at the same time telling us that they pittied us, as we must evidently remain somewheres in Mexico possibly for months to come. But believing that from the greater importance of Mazatlan as a sea port, and place of business, we concluded after resting a day in Tepec to proceed thither, although it was yet another week's journey, the result of which will be seen greatly to our advantage. April 9th  Day warm and clear. In company with a friend (Mr. Sayre), I proceeded this morning at an early hour, several miles out of town upon the summet of a neighboring mountain; (it being a day rest for our animals &c) from the heights of which, an extensive and most beautiful view opened in every direction To the east we saw the lofty peaks of Novelio mountain, and very many of those pretty woodless, and grass covered egg shaped hills before mentioned. Far beyond which formidable mountains reared their misty shadows in dim outline high upon the horizon, upon which the morning's sun had already arissen in his glory amid flitting clouds. The South, thesome great chain of mountains ranged with their many lofty peaks; South west a beautiful valley continued for miles,  with a high mountain ranging west of it. The same mountain  approaching to within a mile of our peak, fell off abruptly  and a valley turned around at right angles with the  former, ranging off into red hills, towards the Pacific Ocean. An extensive and magnificent view broke upon us from  the North, which I endeavored to sketch as in No. 83. North East were seen mountains and peaks piled upon  mountains, many of which were seen far above the mists  and detached clouds of the morning. Here the country  descends rapidly upon the Pacific plains, which are  nearly two days journey from Tepec. The plains could  be seen far on the dim horizon but not the Ocean. This scene was extensive and grand beyond description. To the north and several hundred feet below us, there was  a circular lake of water, No. 84. partly covered with  green rushes, and edged by high walls of rocks, being rugged  bluffs of dark brown rocks, in places covered with a red soil. This lake was nearly round, and elevated several  hundred feet above the valley of Tepec, and exhibited  all the signs of having been at some period a vastcrater to this volcanic country, but now filled up  with water. We then descended into a deep ravine, at the  foot of the hill (letter A) No 84. Through which a fine large stream  water descended rapidly upon a rocky bed. Near the foot  of hill A. is located an extensive cotton factory belonging to Mess  Forbes & Co. as in sketch No 85 .and sketch No 86. taking  two different views of this handsome establishment. The proprietors I believe are Englishmen. Their garden  of Bannanas, Plantains, Oranges and other tropical fruits, is extensive, and exceedingly beautiful, and  more to the idea of some Hindoo scene than one in Mexico. The whole scenery about this factory is  pretty, tasty and romantic. This establishment does  an extensive business. We returned to town by 2.O. clock P.M. after which I sketched the interior of our  Mason (No 87.) or public house, which was tastefull constructed;  our quarters however were not as agreeable as the  appearance of the place. The church on the plaza was large  but of an ordinary appearance, and another similar one  in the town, but a very handsome one of smaller dimensions  1 1/2 miles from the plaza, which time would not  permit me to sketch, and attend to other duties.A hasty sketch of the plaza was also taken as in No 88. It was surrounded by large shade trees of the oak; and in the centre of it there was a pretty fountain of a plain but neat appearance. The plaza was almost entirely surrounded by colonade rows of usually two Story Stores of the first class. The streets of the town ran uniformly at right angles; were clean, and well paved; the same at Gaudalaxhara, the towns of Logos, and San Louis Potosi, etc. The rooves of the houses were uniformly flat, generally one story in height, frequently whitewashed, or neatly ornamented with various colors. But the suburbs of the town, as usual for Mexico, was surrounded by small mud cabins which so much destroys the good effects of Scenery about the Mexican towns, villages, Rancho's etc. At Tepec, we met another American party, and here also 10 of our company left us in order to proceed a distance of 60 miles to San Blass, and from thence embark upon a vessel they had never seen, which afterwards proved to be unseaworthy and landed them some 9 or 10 days afterwards at Mazatlan in (distress and other) difficultiesWe had remonstrated with them however at Tepec, and there they considered their chances much superior to ours. [*April 10th*]  Day warm and clear. Left Tepec at an early hour, and proceeded through a northwest pass, among red hills, little coves, and small narrow and fertile vallies among Shady groves, palms, Bannanas, Plantains, Oranges, &c. and when plenty of watermellons could be  obtained very cheap with other fruits, this region of the country appeared well setled with neat and Shady Ranches, and well supplied with running streams of water. Many farms here appeared like little paradis's for shade romance, and the comforts of life; and many were the  varied scenes of this [day] morning that were really captivating. [except] But in the after part of the day upon the planes, having descended upon a warmer country, we were  open more to the sun, and much annoyed by dust. In making our grand descent upon the plains, we passed down over a long rotine of rugged hills, that gradually diminished as we descended, being sparcely covered with large Palm trees, some underbrush, and now and then parched, prarie grass not of much interest. The view however on descending was extensive, as in sketch No 89.Having descended upon the Pacific Plains, we were  again in a much warmer climate. We again passed from the dull monotony of timbers upon the mountains when such may be found, to a lower country where a large variety were daily presented to our notice. We now saw Palms in great abundance, large oaks, the Banyan, Beach, some cedar, large cotton bearing trees, tropical fruit trees plentifully, with many whose species were unknown to us. We passed several small villages on the planes, and a number of Ranchos. Enormous trees of a species with which I am not familiar, but resembling the mulberry somewhat in shape  and leaf, and in other respects the Beach tree, grows by the road side in many places, and being dense for spreading and of very great magnitude, it frequently gave us an acceptable shade; during our travels across the planes. These five large shade trees, are however not too abundant, and by seeing them in the distance I frequently judged our distance from a Rancho; as they are favorite trees on these planes. This afternoon we crossed two almost dry beds of wheat when flush were called rivers, but not of great magnitudeOn this days route fruits, Mellons, etc, were plentiful and cheap. 16 Bannanas for 6 1/4 cts or a Madeau, A fair water mellon for a Madeau (6 1/4 cts) 1 madeau for a dish of beans stew'd with some meat. 1 madeau for 3 boiled eggs, and 1 madeau for 4 or 6 tortelias or corn cakes; As we had found it on the other side of the Cordilleres, we also experienced here; high prices in Scarce and barren places, and cheap things where the soil was good, well settled, and fruit groves, etc, consequently to be found. About 3 O. clock P.M. our train halted for the night at a Rancho 33 miles N west of Tepec which I sketched as in No 90. The water of a neighboring creek being warm, a part of our company were in to bathe. During this night Mr Davis (who joined us some days back) was scalded by the accidental overturning of our large camp kettle, in which was stewing a fine mess of chicken, supposed to have been done by wolves, that were heard about just before I was on duty as one of the Sentinels from 12 to 2 and several times, heard the wolves, Mr D was not badly scalded however. [*April 11th*]  Day clear and hot. Commenced our march at an early hour, and soon forded a broad and very rocky creek, and during the morning passed through several acceptable woodland groves.Passed a number of ranchos where fruits &c. were plenty and cheap; and the country now generally quite levil. About noon, we came upon the broad sandy beach of a river. Our saddles, baggage, &c. was conveyed across in small boats, (canoes) whilst the whole drove of our animals swam the river together. The scene was  interesting and having a few moments (after just finishing a fine large water mellon) I sat down and  sketched the river, Mountains, &c., as in View No 91. The mountains were still in view; and follow upon our right, all the way to Mazatlan, as we are now persuing our way up the coast, though not yet in Sight of the Pacific Ocean. This river which we have just now crossed (I was told) is called the \"Rio San Diago\", being about 18 Mexican leagues from Tepec, or something over 50 miles. Having crossed the River, whilst the mules was reloading &c. for our further progress, most of our company went into a town nearby (of some size) and refreshed themselves upon fruits, coffee, chocolate, eggs, &c. etc. The town though of good size, was dilapidated and of an ordinary appearance, though commanding apretty location. Persuing our course over a very dusty road that wound hither and thither upon a levil country of brushwood and larger clusters of timber, we passed through a village of perhaps 40 or more houses, all entirely deserted, except one, which was tennanted by one Solitary man of a fierce countenance, being a cripple, who had only a few poor mellons for sale at high rates. This was rather strange yet strangely true, one man the Sole lord of a desolate village, no other Mexican was seen in the whole place, and all was closed up without Signs of furniture; the place may have fell into the hands of Robbers, or be unhealthy; we did not ask respecting it of the man, although it excited remarks in our company. This afternoon afforded but little of interest except some large cotton fields, with ripe cotton, belonging to some Ranchos, and surrounded by fences, which is an uncommon thing in this country, fences are very  rare throughout all Mexico. we travelled many hundred miles without even seeing a fence; although there may be many farms, it is not every man that has a fence, and even those who posess them mostly have very short appologies for fences, which  are rare things in Mexico,I mean fences of wood stone fences of great length, have been seen almost every day or two, amongst the settled parts of the mountains. To day we saw, as beforementioned, fine fields of cotton; but for the first time that I remember in Mexico. We also saw a wild tree about the size and shape of an ordinary apple tree, bearing large and numerous pods of the fine white cotton; And a number of curious fruit trees about the woodlands and water courses. Much of this days travels, all things considered is not by any means inviting to travellers; being dusty in places open to the hot sun, and much of the time rather uncivilized in appearance, which however is no criterion to judge western Mexico by. Before sunset we halted, after a long days march at the Rancho of \"Buena Vista\" being about 145 miles from Mazatlan. I sketched this place as in No 92. A friend Mr Custer, and I went out afar the creak near by for game, and we returned in about 15 minutes with 3 large Pheasants upon which we made a fine supper, and obtained plenty more for our breakfast, and to carry with us for our dinner, our company numbering at this time between 25 and 30. Since leaving Tepec, those for San Blass taking  another road.[*April Thorsd 12th*] Left our Rancho at an early hour. Day clear and hot; with the usual afternoon winds from the Pacific. Passed over an extensive palm country this day, gentle slopes all day covered sparcely with tall and scattered Palm trees, grass burnt off for miles in places; much wild game by the way, few habitations, and those generally of the lowest class. In the morning sketched No 93. of the lofty peaks &c. of the  Cordilleres on our night, which are always in full view in passing up the coast . About noon we again came  to the bank of another River which was partly dry, and at this season fordable, I did not ask its name, but the town of Cauponetta , was on the opposite side to which we forded. A number of Mexican women were along the margin of this river at their customary employment of  washing out clothing; one very clear trait of the Mexicans. Sketch No 94. shows, the river, town, and mountain scenery from opposite Cauponette Puebla. After refreshing  ourselves upon mellons, fruit, etc, in this pleasant town we proceeded forward at a rapid gait to finish a long days march. Much of our road was very dusty, though there was less wind than usual; our country slightly rolling and upon the night a full view of the lofty mountains of the coast.This night we encamped at a desolate Rancho a few miles beyond a river, where things had a distressing appearance we could neither obtain water or food of any importance at this place, so that most of us had neither supper nor breakfast. The appearance of everything about these few huts, was perfectly squallid, and the natives almost totally unclothed and appearing reckless and unconcerned about any thing. We camped beside the road, and huts, and kept strict watch during the night; but a few miles back, on the other side of the river we could have encamped at a small village, where all the conveniences were at hand, but being only a few days from Mazatlan, our company became very anxious to finish their land travels in Mexico, and consequently pressed each day. We missed it, decidedly in crossing the river this night, as we left a pleasant camp grove and conveniences at that place, for a desolate place where we lost two meals, and had no water either for our animals or ourselves  April 13th  Day warm and clear with a fine seabreeze this afternoon Passed through a nearly level country, covered with scattering palms; we came to a village of a squallid appearance about 10. O.clock A.M. where by much trouble we made out to get something to  eat.of all squallid places we had yet seen, this village was the climax. Here in front of a cabin, sat a wretched looking woman clothed in rags, and her feet projecting on the walk from a heavy pair of wooden stocks, where she was fastened probably for some offence. The whole of the inhabitants were almost entirely unclothed and appeared to be living in misery and starvation. Having the bold mountains on our right which were all day in full view, we proceeded onward up the coast through Palm forrests, that seem'd never ending, and towards noon oppressively hot; several crosses were passed this day; whilst this section of the country appeared very much uncivilized; and we frequently met men, entirely without clothing. A range of mountains seem'd now to range off west to the Pacific Ocean, over which it appeared that we must pass, on the morrow; approaching within a few miles of their wild and rugged base, we encamped at a Rancho called Cerauso, as in Sketch No 95. here things appeared more genteel than on the previous night and we were enabled to purchase a scanty allowance of provisions, which were in demand and highly acceptable.April 14th Day clear and hot, Left our rancho at an early hour, and proceeded along the base of rugged mountains directly west to within some 5 or 6 miles of the Pacific beach, but not in sight of the ocean, as we came upon a low ground, we passed around the end of those mountains, and travelled over flat planes covered with high grass, and in places pools of Salt water, and yet on this day we did not see the ocean, although at one time we were said to be quite near to the beach. from the edge of a Small Salt lake, I sketched some large and high rocks, which were the terminus of the mountains and nearest to the ocean as in No. 96. I had no time to ascend it, or I may have possibly first beheld the Pacific from its Summet. Again we appeared to direct our course inward from the coast, which brought us in the afternoon to a broad river, with wide beaches of sand and gravel. This stream we forded and entered the pleasant town of Rosario as in sketch No. 97. The location of this town with its mountain scenery was very pretty and interesting. Fruits of every kind with fine mellons were very abundant and cheap in this place. The churchwas large, antiquated, but of handsome finish; up the river about two miles and upon the opposite side, there appeared in full view a similar building of great magnitude, and from its colors and peculiar structure appearing to be much superior to the building in Rosario. Mountains of great magnitude were from 5 to 10 miles to the eastward. In the afternoon we left this pleasant and populous town, and persuing our way among gently rolling hills Palm groves, and vast tracts of brushy oaks, Bodock trees & we encamped at a village of a genteel but  odd appearance; where provisions were plenty, and cheap, and the inhabitants quite friendly. Oranges, mellons &c plentiful. April. 15th  Day clear and hot, persued our course at an early hour, travelling the same routine of plains, rolling grounds, gullies, Palm forrests, &c this day we passed through many miles of Bodock trees, which much resembled an orchard of civilization, extending, far beyond the reach of the eye, with many thousands of bushels of large Bodock apples; I have no doubt but that in time, the seed of these trees will be sought after  for making hedge fences over countries where timber may be scarce. At noon we passed through a fine large townand stopped for a time to refresh ourselves at the market plazas; immense quantities of watermellons were seen in every direction; Soon a large congregation of Ladies, Gentlemen, and civilized looking people came pouring forth from a  large and antiquated church upon the plaza; and people quietly on their way to their houses, though viewing our company with some little surprise and attention. From this town we persued our way over \"slightly rolling\" country of Palms, oaks, and in places a variety of timbers and encamped at night as usual at a rancho. April. 16th Day clear and hot. Persued our journey at an early hour being in full view of Mountains all day, sometimes among hills, and at others upon plains of Palms or extensive groupes of underbrush, with scattering trees of magnitude. The mountain Scene No 98. was sketched this afternoon, from the summet of a Small hill. during the day we passed over several open praries and at night encamped at a rancho of a respectabe appearance beside a fine stream of good water. April 17th Day clear and hot. Persued our journey at Sunrise in order to reach Mazatlan this day. During themorning our road wound considerably amongst small hills, and was sparcely timbered with some Palms, Oaks, &c during the whole day, except where Salt lakes had left level planes of Sand, with not even vegetation Sometimes for miles in some directions upon one of these sand beds, I witnessed to day, what is called mirage, or the deception of water, ahead. For some time I supposed that we were coming to the margin of a lake whose waters were troubled into waves by wind, but on approaching the same, I discovered the mistake; by discovering that the heat of the Sun caused a mist to arise from the sand, which by its position and  reflection to the eye caused the deception called mirage. about noon we arrived in the old village of Mazatlan distant from the present Sea port of Mazatlan, about 24  miles. At present it is a place no importance, and is much dilapidated; we obtained some fruit here and proceeded on our journey to the port of Mazatlan, before leaving this place I sketched the ruins of an ancient church at one corner of the old village Square as in Sketch No 99. Shortly after leaving this place we forded a river, and persued our course over a level ground towards the Pacific OceanSketch No 100. was taken 15 miles from the Port of Mazatlan. Those hills on its back ground are along the Pacific, and several of them stand out in the Ocean. The foreground is a Sandy plain, on which at w, I thought I saw the lake of water, which as I was very thirsty at the time, appeared quite acceptable, and after taking the sketch, I dashed away full speed with my horse, to reach it with the company, but it proved to be a very complete deception of water. Approaching within 8 miles of the Pacific, we came to the bank of a Salt lake, which I sketched as in No 101. showing the distant hills near the port of Mazatlan. At 6 miles I took another sketch as in No 102. whilst we were passing around the Salt lake. The fresh breeze was fanning us from the pacific; the declining Sun was shedding his gentler evening rays upon us from over the hills of the Port of Mazatlan, as we wound our way around that pretty lake before named, and crossing the flats, we arising suddenly upon a high ground came at once in full view of the long sought for port of Mazatlan, and for the first time a broad and beautiful view of the Pacific Ocean, its islands, shipping, and its foaming  surfs that chased each other rapidly upon the pretty beach before us. What a captivating view; two great objects at one view, the Pacific, and the port of Mazatlan  with also the gratification of now closing our land,  journey across Mexico, and again embarking upon the  mighty waters of the Ocean; and thus ending the second great chapter after leaving Philadelphia, and about to  enter now upon a third important change. All  the past toils were passed over without a murmur, when arriving here, none would of course return by the same way should such ever offer, but none were sorry that they had encountered the toils and fatigues of this journey when they knew it had now closed by land, and was about to commence by Sea; and all were of course well pleased and quite merry on entering the town with their prospects of soon being at Sea; and done with Mexico."

    "paragraph": "Having been some time impressed with the belief that a trip to California would be beneficial not only in a pecuniary point of view, but likewise to the better regulation of health and future happenings, I resolved about the 1st of January of 1849 to have my profession that of a Mathematical Instrument Maker and the eve to be remembered Monumental city of Baltimore for a trip to the golden shores of the far western El Dorado. Circumstances favoring, I made preparations in Philadelphia presuming that my trip thither would be made by sea around Cape Horn a distance of 7000 miles in the Ship \"Mason\" which advertised to leave that port several times fixing definite days of departure. Mr W.H. Ogden called upon me requesting my naming in forming a company then to be limited to 10 or 15 select gentlemen. I consented and gave my name as one of the party them numbering three, whose names were W. H. Ogden, B Jay Antrim and W Middleton, the latter of whom had since resigned and remained at his residence in New Jersey. Mr Ogden and myself drew up a notice at Mr Bonsals' Book Store, at No 33 1/2 Market Street, Philadelphia and inserted the same in the \"Ledger,\" and \"North American.\" The advertisment requesting all desirous of making a speedy and an agreeable journey via Matamoras, Monterey, Saltileo, Durango and Mazatlan to California to address \"Camargo,\" at the office's of those two respective papers, which was soon followed by a number of applicants; who were severally visited by Mr Ogden and myself. Mr Jones, of 6th Street, being the first of that number added to our list. We soon procured a room for meeting at No 100 Chestnut Street through the kindness Majors Collins and Ross, where we met in harmony and concert of action until we had completed our company and extended the number of the same to Forty. At one of the Meetings, the name of \"Camargo Company\" was adopted, which is the name of a Mexican town, to which we were first destined from Philadelphia, by sea, and from thence after having procured there our outfit of mules provissions & to proceed overland to Mazatlan via the abovementioned route. Old resolutions adopted in our \"Camargo\" meetings limiting our numbers were several times rescinded and new ones were adopted until our number had increased to forty as before mentioned & Committees of Camp Equipage, provissions, pasports, protections, for chartering a vessel &c all of whoom acted and reported accordingly. Having ascertained that the abovenamed route was infested with hoards of warlike and savage Camanchee Indians, who were committing outrages and massacring those found in their way, and that the same route was in consequence very dangerous, and believing it rash, as also influenced by friends, I withdrew my name from that route, and proposed the Tampico route to the company as the safest, most pleasant, and a shorter land distance than the former; which then being unfavorably received, I withdrew by advice, and my own impressions of that course, and then prepared to proceed around by Cape Horn. In the mien time, the company adopted the Tampico route via San Louis Potosi &c. and —Mr. Ogden called upon me to inform me of it and his desire with many of my old friends was that I should return to the company: and as they had changed the rout to the one I thought most prefferable, I again added my name. Mr Ogden was elected President and myself Secretary of the \"Camargo Company,\" and in my leaving Mr W Robinson, merchant, was elected to supply my place, in which by request and his absence I served several times after my return. A committee appointed chartered the Brig \"Thomas Walters,\" to convey our company of forty to Tampico in Mexico, which was contracted for at $50.00 each, for cabin passage, and the vessel advertised to sail at 8 O Clock A.M. on the 31st of January 1849. Four members declined going with us and three others filled their vacancies. In consequence of some difficulty in entering our articles at the custom house for Mexico, whereby our Captain and vessel was in danger of the laws of Mexico, - our departure was delayed until 9.0.clock A.M. on the following morning the 1st of February. Feb 1st Slight Snow, cold and finally sleety rain; I repaired with all remains of baggage to the vessel at an early hour, and found many congregated to witness our departure. The crowds along the wharves notwithstanding the inclemency of the weather, continued to increase until many hundreds lined the surrounding piers. A few minutes before 9.0.clock our company repaired with arms to two lines upon the Quarter Deck, and fired from guns and pistols a departing salute. Mr Robinson then presented - \"three cheers to our Country\", which our company responded to with warmth - \"three cheers to the friends and dear bonnie lassies, we leave behind,\" and it burst simultaneously from the very hearts of all. - and \"three cheers to Philadelphia\" which we answered appropriately according with our sentiments of the Quaker City. The citizens upon the wharves responded - \"three cheers for the success of the Carmago Company\" followed by a succession of cheers for individuals named in our company, among which the clerk of the Ship \"Mason,\" observing my singular dress in common with my comrades and knowing me, gave \"three cheers for the Buckskin Injnn.\" and thus did our friends cheer us at the hour of separating from all that was dear to us, to embark upon the great and eventful Ocean of future prospects. About, 9.0.clock A.M. the steamboat \"Wave' came beside and before night towed us in co with another vessel as far as New Castle. At New Castle we dropped anchor for the night, and finding a mistake of six packages of provisions which were nescessary for the completion of the captains' manifest for Mexico, it was found requisite to send Mr Thompson, immediately back to Philadelphia in order to bring on the same by express, which he did by an early hour on the following morning, and received a vote of thanks from the company. This evening was spent with considerable spirit and mirth on the part of Messrs Robinson, C. Jones and Bates; which however was excused by the company in general as they were known to be gentleman, and believed to be unaccustomed to such heavy exercises. Besides the leaving of home under the deepest immaginable of melancholly feelings. This day a vote was taken in the affirmative for prohibiting the smoking of cigars in either cabin of the Brig, the quantity of powder and combustibles on board beeing deem'd a sufficient reason. The Roll was called and the following gentlemen answered to their names, --  to wit. Some of our company went on shore at New Castle and made some few purchases of small articles. Have up anchor at an early hour, and got under way towards the breakwater. weather cold and hazy. Proceeded but a short distance this day and cast anchor 2 miles below Reedy Island, in the afternoon where we remained until 4.0.clock the next morning. Weather clear and cold with a North West wind which drove us out the bay in a beautiful and interesting manner with full canvass on a bounding sea. Personal feelings were consulted over the guard in a member of cases, and after, relief expressed. My feelings were much agitated in consequence of the heavy ocean [swells], and I left an elegant dinner of soup and chickens to contemplate the foamingbillows, and returned when convenient to finish the same, which I did in a few minutes with more relish after having cast over a full account much to the relief of my inexpressible feelings. The dinner table was left patronized by our gents than on the day previous, who were also contemplating the foaming billows with the same inexpressible feelings. One instance of inebriation occurred this day which created unpleasant feelings between the captain and said individual, but was amicably settled to the benefit of said person and any of the company, should they in future indulge, which it is presumed they will not doo, as many if not nearly the whole of them, appear to be temperate and sensible men. This evening being much moderated, with a clear and beautiful Moon, most of our party promenade the whole round of the vessel in rapid Military order, whilst the brig bounded upon the long and high Ocean Swells with that majesty becomming the bread bosom of the Atlantic; whilst the spray threw up to the bowsprit and the sheeted sides, it's showery foam, gilded by the silvery rags of the Moon, and followed in the wake  by a long bright trail of foaming ripples receding in our pathway back to the horizon.Our boat dashed on handsomely to the tune of a brisk wind, whilst the music and merry songs of the happier ones arose in concert with the gently whistling winds that playfully tuned their ocean song amid our rigging and canvass. The whole scene was exceedingly  interesting, and the music harmonious,  being sung by good voices, well timed, and filled with the deepest base voice, for a human being that I ever heard, which added greatly to the sweetness of the music; they sang numerous songs that had more richness amid a scene like this, than I had ever before supposed could be the case; I enjoyed it very much. Harmony and quietness prevail generally throughout the cabins, and no discords have occurred this day. A clear, mild, and beautiful morning. I rose early in order to behold the Sun rise over the ocean, which was beautifully decorated  with long light clouds, which partly shaded its disk and gave more glowing colors to the scene; At 10. A.M. a meeting for worship,was called on the after dark, and Revd Mr. Woods,  officiated, assisted by the Revd Mr Blake, nearly each  member attend the meeting; which was conducted  with very creditible solemnity and attention. The  subject was to those who go down upon the great  deep, with a copy of an address delivered by a Revd  gentleman to the young gentleman of Boston, on emigrating  to California, and the choice of good society. A pistol exploded from firing last night, and Mr. Robinson  was cut back of the right shoulder by a piece  at least 5 inches in length, the would though sore  to stay is not however dangerous. This afternoon  many guns and pistols were fired at the little  dog sharks, that are now following our vessel in  numbers; 7 or 8 of which were caught and hauled  on board with fish hooks and lines; they were  usually two feet in length, and bore some resemblance  to the common pike. This afternoon we have  made but little progress, owing to a calm, and  have hardly average 2 knots an hour for half the day,  Towards night clouds arose with sprinkling rain  and there was a general disposition to be in doors. Monday 5th - Up before sunrise and saw the sparkling ocean spray as our galliant boat drove swiftly o'er mountain waves before a fierce gale which changed to a storm by noon, a day long to be remembered by many of our sea sick company. Such a sight all over the Brig, it only kneeds  an old sea faring man to judge of over 30 green ones just ushered to sea in a fierce gale with rain pelting them like so much fine shot; and they bounding sky high on mountain billows. The bounding of our vessel was truly majestic and far beyond what I had ever before witnessed; all sails were tied up and nothing but the small stay sail open to the gale during the afternoon Nearly the whole company were sick, including myself, but I did not so much as loose one meal by it. I soon had an apetite, which was also  the case with many others; few however were at dinner this day. Upon the whole it was a day of miserable sickening, storm, gales and long billows many of which were full 25 feet in perpendicular height.clouds, rain, howling winds and high sea raged all day Tues 6th Beautiful clear morning, after a terrible night of high winds and high billows. To day the ocean moved in immense swells like small hills, with yawning vallies between, but the morning was clear, and the air mild and further fire unescessary. Our stove being upset this morning we did not rectify it, nor feel the need of it. The sick ones are improving and getting lively; the vessel has bounded on beautifully all day, and we crossed the Gulf Stream this morning, winds from the west which drove us out to sea, possibly 350 miles from land, and this evening a little south of the lattitude of Charleston of South Carolina. Saw one sail to the west this morning. Light clouds in the afternoon, and pleasant moonlight evening, with the sea and winds pretty high. Company merry on deck, & Saw one porpose, 5 or 6 nautilus, and gulf weed this morning all interesting to one looking for a subject. It should have been mentioned that Mr. Hewes, one of our company, lost his belt overboard yesterday containing two hundred and twenty five dollars in gold.Wednesday 7th A cloudy morning, high winds and mountain billows; air cool and winds mostly from the west. We bounded on bravely all this day o'er the foaming sea, realing too and fro, with our deck at times almost at an angle of 45, both side ways and lengthwise. The dishes on the dinner table partook likewise of the general commotion. This whole day was another of swift winds, amounting almost to a gale, which stirred up the billious temperaments of our company as usual, and there were many sick ones about deck again as usual. At 12, at noon, we passed a sail in the distance and at 1.0.clock P.M. another to which we hoisted a red flag with red star upon a square white ground, which they answered with the American flag; the winds and the ocean being  to high to speak them. They were bound to the States. We passed them in about Latitude 32 and about 400 miles out to sea from South Carolina. At night the moon rose amid flying clouds, but the air was so cool, the wind so high, and our deck so much wet by the spray from theangry mountaneous ocean, that few remained on deck long; the berths being prefferable. It is not an uncommon thing to hear one or two fall out of their berths, upon the floor, and to observe a general scrambling of boots, hats, trunks, &c for a downhill race to the opposite sides of the cabin whilst cradling upon the high blue  ribs of the ocean. Then occasionally springing a breeze. Thursd 8th Light clouds, air mild, and a pleasant breeze from the North East, with light ocean waves. Held a meeting on financial arrangements on the Quarterdeck at 10.A.M. Saw a ship ahead this morning bound southward in Latitude 29° 40,\" about 400 miles out to sea. Fine sunny day with bland breezes and very light ocean swells. Nearly all of our company are amusing themselves about decks variously. Catching sea weeds, and fifty other little time killing amusements. At 4 O.clock P.M. we held a meeting on the Quarterdeck during which time we elected Mr. Grant, our Captain, for the trip over Mexico to Mazatlan. Mr. McCrellish, 1st Lieutenant, Mr. Hughes, 2nd do Mr. W. H. Ogden the Quarter Master, and Mr. Thompson, the Commissary. It being understood that we go through during our voyage, a regular Military drilling in order to fit us for cases of insurgency in our Mexican Campaign. A pleasant moonlight evening, air mild, with a brisk breeze, and sailing about 10 Knots the hour. Friday 9th A beautiful morning of pleasant breezes; up early and saw the sun rise clear upon the rolling ocean. We sailed beautifully all day with a fine breeze. Things passed off pleasantly and merrily all day, with a mild and elegant moonlight evening; set up until 11.O.clock, hearing and telling wonderful things, which were magic charms, when told by moonlight on so mild and exquisite evening as this, added the gentle undulations of the sea, the fountains of spray, and the bland Zephyrs of the South. Saw a number of white flying fish during this afternoon, which were beautiful and attractive. Sat 10th A clear, warm, and calm morning, sun even getting hot Near, but not in sight of the West Indies. No wind and almost quiet; Ocean almost quiet; This day proved to be a regular calm, and the sun very warm. Coats and vests off, and hardly a breeze. We do not appear to have moved 15 miles all day. A breeze sprung up in the evening and got us under headway at about 5 knots, with a pleasant late moonlight night. A flying fish came on board this evening and was captured. All are well so far on the vessel. Sund 11th Morning warm, clear, and a brisk wind driving us at the rate of 10 knots towards the island with the \"hole in the wall\", but not in sight yet (11 A.M.) Came in sight of the Bahamia island at 1/2 past 11. A.M. but there being a high head wind, we lost all this afternoon and night in tacking too and from the land, with a high sea. Held a meeting  for worship this afternoon at 1/2 past 3.O.clock. Rev'd Mr. Woods delivered a powerful and highly eloquent appeal to our company, with a good effect. A request was sent to our Chaplain (elect) by several individuals, to their discredit, not to hold services on board; but it being overruled by a large majority, services were held as usual. Monday 12th Mild with high head winds, only about 10 miles gained by tacking the whole day. We were insight of the islands several times during the day. At night a black and angry storm rolled over us with rain and fierce winds raising huge billows, howling and tossing us fearfully about on the ocean all night. Silent fear reign'd in our company, but some hardened cases went so far as to make sport in the midst of this exciting scene. Tuesday 13th Passed the \"hole in the wall,\" with light house early this morning. The sun rose beautifully in a fleecy cloud of golden hue, and a brisk wind drove us rapidly towards the Bahamia Bar, the day is clear, mild, and our Brig passed 5 other vessels this morning all bound in the same direction. Arrived at the Bahamia Bar, at 12 Meridian, and crossed it during the afternoon and evening; The water on the Bar is from 15 to 40 feet generally, and sufficiently clear in most places to see bottom at 15 feet. The bottom appears to be composed of white sand, with here and there patches of sponge. The color of the water on the Bar for about 60  miles is a beautiful light Skye Blue, whilst that of the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico is of a darkand blue color. we passed Berry islands this morning and saw there, a number of small sailing craft, and some about a wrecked vessel. A colored gentleman has a very fine farm, and several wives upon one of these singular looking islands. A good breeze drove us on rapidly ahead of all other vessels. The day has been warm clear, and the sun set among gilded clouds showing us a scene exciting universal admiration. Such a glowing sun set scene, few of us have ever before witnessed even in midsummer. There is something exquisite, glowing, brilliant and more diversified with brilliant and unapproachable colors accompanying a sun set scene in this southern chime, that seldom occurs to those farther north, and infinitely above the Artists pencil. [*Wednesday 14th *] Temperature mild, high and favorable wind driving us rapidly to the South west over the gulf of Mexico. No land in sight this morning. Saw several hundred flying fish this afternoon; the vessel appeared to scare them out of the water. We travelled very rapidly all this day and night.[*Thursd 15th*] Morning clear and mild, with a strong breeze driving us rapidly ahead, no land in sight. The gulf is here of a bluish brown appearance and occasionally when the sun is in a certain position of a greenish cast. Our vessel is now dashing off spray and waves of white foam as though she were ploughing by steam. One of our company Mr Chevallier, fell  down our cabin stairs this morning, but was not seriously injured, though stunned by the (long) fall. [*Frid 16th*] Morning clear, warm, and a regular calm. We were lying still at sun rise, but a breeze sprung up during the morning which increased to a strong wind during the afternoon, and drove us forward quite rapidly. This day was warm and clear. Saw many flying fish as usual with some Nautilus, & the Gulf waters appear now nearly black. The spray is flying skye high o'er deck, and we are dashing onward within about 550 miles of Tampico. Cool, high head wind, rough sea and day generally  cloudy, a day of but little interest. Cool, wind from the North, a strong gale with some rain, sea very high and disagreeable. Saw large schools of Porpoises, at several different times playing about the bow of the vessel, flying fish abundant, with occasionally some curious sea birds. This whole day & night has been exceedingly boisterous and unpleasant. Mon.d 19th  Morning clear, air mild, fair wind and travelling pretty fair. The sick ones of yesterday are getting lively again. no land yet in sight. pleasant evening and travelling rapidly ahead. Tues.d 20th  Morning clear, mild, with fair wind and rapid travelling within 200 miles of Tampico. Wed.nd 21st  Warm and clear. Gulf in a calm. discovered  land at 1/2 past 12 P.M. a fair breeze in the afternoon water of the Gulf getting quite green. The coast of Mexico ranges in barren and here and there partly cultivated hills. very Singular scenery. The pilots came out to us at 4 P.M. and took us into Tampico by dark, being up a small and crooked river about 6 1/2 miles. Vegetation &c was all green and the Spring verdure was here in all its richness fully displayed. The breakers running upon the shore were quite interesting and our entranceto Tampico over the bar was quite favorable. The  county about Tampico is in flats and broken hope  and there into low rolling hills of a peculiar  appearance, covered here and there with dense Chaparell. An officer boarded our vessel and examined  our passports, and we anchored off Tampico in the  river Rio Paneuco. Many porposes were playing  in the gulf as we entered the river. it was a beautiful sun set scene, and the weather quite warm.  we were not permitted to go on shore this evening. We have now arrived in Mexico, 20 1/2 days from  the wharf in Philadelphia. Clear. & Warm like August. landed this morning  at 10.A.M. in Tampico. went to the city Plaza and  examined strange costoms, dress, appearances of things &c. wandered with friends about town and suburbs all  day except when our baggage passed the Custom  House, when we had all taken to private rooms  rented for our company. Our impressions of Tampico  and the Mexicans in general, was at first quite unfavorable,  but in a few days becoming more familiarized with their  very singular manners and appearances, we felt more at home Tampico. State of Tamaulipas. Mexico. 23rd For one Real or 12 1/2 cts in company with a friend I crossed the  Rio or river Paneuco, to the shore of the State of Vera Cruz, from which place I sketched Tampico, as per plate No. 1. To a citizen of the States unaccustomed to foreign life, it at once presents an oriental appearance. There are two plaza's or public squares in the city the principal one facing the  river and the other back, upon which two of the Military posts and a small plain cathedral are located. The streets run generally at right angles, and three fourths of the  houses are one story in height, without chimnies, window glass, boards, or brick; being usually constructed either of bamboo, mud, or stone, which are generally plastered upon the exterior surface, and occasionally painted. The roof of each principal dwelling generally partaking of the usual Mexican trait, though more Americanized than  most other Mexican cities. The suburbs are almost entirely composed of cabins of Bamboo, thatched with the leaves of  the palmetto. The city is located upon a slightly undulating ground and almost entirely surrounded by water. The many singular plants with the beautiful flowers and foliage of spring combined with the lively colors of the dwellings, gave to Tampico, a singular and highly interesting appearance. The mainplaza, is paved with limestone (vide sketch No 2.) in the centre of which there is a large circular pediment of limestone rising in 6 steps, upon the summet of which there was once a monument of Santa Anna; which has been destroyed in their Revolutionary events. The building marked No 1. belongs to the British government; it is a costly and handsome establishment, and is  the head quarters for the immense quantities of silver, brought from the mines of San Louis Polosi. The markets are held every morning upon a part of this plaza. It is inferior to those in the States, though more abundantly stocked with the tropical fruits, at much less prices. Beef, fowls, fish, eggs, cheese, beans, peas, yams, tomatoes, &c with Lemons, Oranges, Bannanna's, plantains, sugar cane, coco nuts, with many vegitables supply this market at cheap rates. Almost every article kept by the Grocers, Dry good Merchants, hardware houses and other merchantile establishments of the States may be found here, but some of the are extravigantly dear. The custom house stands upon the main plaza facing a wooden pier upon the river. Coffee, sugar, rice, tea, tobacco and some other articles are virtually prohibited by their duties. Our party had about $20 worth of the essence of tea, the duties of which was over $30. No. 2 is the dwelling of Mr. Chase the American Counsil.The costom house officers are in general exceedingly punctilious and exact, but a small gold piece, has occasionally induced some of them as in other parts of the Republic, to put on  green spectacles. Our company of 40. were all presented to a tall thin and dignified praefect or chief Alcalde, who signed each pasport, for which he charged each $1. We occupied 3 large rooms in a retired part of the city,  near one of the principal barracks, and a part of the  time cooked our own provisions. We saw several military parades, as large forces were temporarily stationed here,  to prevent a rise on the part of the citizens of this city and State for independence, and annexation to Texas, or  in plain words Annexation to the United States. There was a patroll of small parties of Soldiers with  drum, fife, beaugles, &c. at almost every hour of the day. The complexion of the Mexicans is generally copper, bronze, and sometimes almost black. Their hair black and straight and their features partaking much of the Indian. I think  there is a marked difference between the features and the  color of the Spaniard and the Aztec Indian of Mexico, but they are called Mexicans. The real Aztec occupies generally the lower grades of life, but they appear tobe by far the most honest, sociable, polite, and hospitable. Though, as in other countries there are very conspicuous exceptions. The Sabbath is but little observed here, church open with most of the stores &c in the morning, and all closed in the  afternoon, for dances called fandango's, cockfights and other amusements, etc. You can get a good cup of coffee on the  plaza, or at the \"Caffe de Reverdy\" for a maydue or 6 1/4 cts. toast bread 6 1/4 cts. a cup of excellent chocolate one Real. 12 1/2 cts. eggs 12 1/2 cts per doz. about 2 1/2 lbs of coarse sugar for a  Quartee or 3 cent piece of silver. Flour is high, and bread dear. Tortelias are very common, when well made they are excellent, they are simply finely pulverized corn baked in large thin wafers, until they snap like thin sea biscuit. The Mexicans do not generally live as well nor in the  same manner as those of the States with some exceptions. I have however, tasted pastries here surpassing any thing of the  kind in the States. Good wine from 37 1/2 to 75. cts per bottle. Freoles, or black beans, plenty, cheap, and excellent. In  dress they are peculiar, with many varieties of fashion, and possibly as different from the Americans (in general) as may be found throughout the whole world. A tapering and broad rim hat called a Sombrero; often a tight  [*But meals are usually charged from 25 to 50. cts. and their appendages in proportion.*]and curiously figured buckskin jacket, over clean linen,  a pair of figured buckskin pants opening and buttoning up from top to heel, under the right and left arm, being small above and as broad as a Sailor below; they are generally unbuttoned as high as the knee or the pocket, exhibiting a pair of fine white linen pants beneath, which are also quite airy. The Mexicans are very clean in their dress, in this respect they far surpass the United States. Even our servants or mule drivers, were dressed in their  clean white linens; a thing most remarkable for this country considering their state of civilization. The Cargador or porter will carry a box or package, and yet appear not to soil his fine linen. The high tariffs of Mexico, prevent  the coarser articles from being imported, consequently the  Mexican markets abound with the finest foreign goods. The cloth, or linen is confiscated if it does not count so many threads to the inch when passing the custom house. Lands held in this country from old titles is good, but that from the government is not safe. Mr. Chase, our American  consul, says that during his stay of 15 years at Tampico, he has known the Mexican government to change 16 times consequently their laws, &c. are but temporary powers of vacilationIt is necessary to have a pasport to enter this country which will cost $2 in the States, to countersigned by the Alcalde of each large town you pass through within 48 hours after your arrival, costing at each place 25.cts. with also a pasport to leave the country; A passport to carry arms, and a passport to carry any amount of money beyond your expenses, at 25 per cent discount. Owing to the  reports respecting the country we had to pass over to San Louis Potosi, 5 of our number withdrew and proceeded by themselves. Mr Grant, then withdrew with a large portion of our company, leaving us but 19, which embodied a separate  mining company, having with them a large amount of mining tools, provisions, medicines, etc. amounting to considerable baggage which the other division thought would detain them some weeks longer in getting through to Mazatlan; consequently that party of 16 organized and proceeded some 5 days in advance of us, and procuring their horses at Mr. Laflers Rancho, or farm, they proceeded with dispatch to San Louis Potosi etc. Our party after selling off some unnecessary articles (as every pound to Mazatlan cost us 40 cts.) proceeded on the journey, having obtained our horses of Mr Lafler; 16 miles up the river of Paneuco. The other party of course expectedto be in San Louis Potosi, at least for 8 days ahead of our tardy mules and mustangs. They arrived in San Louis Potosi on the evening of the 21st of March, and our party at sun rise next morning to their surprise, as this journal from Tampico, will show. During our stay in Tampico, many of our party formed acquaintances in this city friendly to the Americans, a disposition evinced throughout the state of Tamaulipas. The weather here is quite as hot as august in the States,  but a fine sea breeze comes from the Gulf of Mexico, every afternoon; that makes our perambulations about town more pleasant. The Senioretta's or Ladies wear no bonnets, but invariably shawls upon their heads, I have seen some that were very beautiful; the early evening is their favorite time of appearance. This is decidedly a great country for moschitoes, ticks, and all kinds of loathesome vermin as we will herein after prove. The States bear not the slightest resemblance in species, quantities, and qualities to them, as they are positively the most numerous and most troublesome inhabitants of Mexico. To pick off 3 or 500 ticks from your pants and coat, as the cost of a venture in some places among the small weeds and bushes, might seem unreasonable, but such is very possible to occurSund 25th  The Priest, has extended an invitation to our company to  attend church. I visited and found but few present. The church is handsomely decorated inside but has a very  antiquated appearance without.  26th No rain and weather excessively warm, and moschetoes  innumerable, and insupportable. I repaired to the bluff  on the river, and from the highest part of it sketched  scene No 3, which comprehends an extensive and interesting  range of country. The first river to the right passing north  is the Rio Tamosee. West of it is the rio Paneuco,  a beautiful little stream meandering off towards San  Louis Potosi, and navigable 150 miles for light draught  boats, through no steamers have yet ascended it for. at fig. 1  is Laflers' Rancho 16 miles up the river; west of it for about  20 miles there is a level prairie. The Mountains fig. 2.  are interesting, as they abound with numerous ancient  walls, curiosities, and remains very similar to those discovered  in Yucatan, by Stephens. An ancient city is  supposed to have covered a number of square miles  on the summet of this mountain; which has been described by Norman of New Orleans. Beyond this west by south  two peaks of immense and distant mountains may be seen  occasionally by a clear sun set.South (fig 3) There is a long and beautiful Lagoona or Lake being about 2 miles wide, beyond it in the direction of Vera Cruz, there are high mountains and fertile plains. In the foreground there is a long tract of prarie, covered with the wild prarie grass, some chaparell bushes, with occasional  patches of low timber, and skirted on the margin of both waters with brushy trees, and one Rancho or (small) farm. [*Mond March 5th*] Weather warm, and yet no rain, but a pleasant  breeze each afternoon. Having all baggage in readiness and our bargains completed for horses and mules, we  embarked with everything belonging to our party in large canoes, in which we made the best of our way up to Laflers' Rancho 16 miles up the Rio Paneuco, to his principal farm or Haciendo, which I sketch'd as in No 4. Showing the Paneuco river, the neighboring mountain which contains its ancient remains of a past city on it and the curious forest in its foreground. This is the  best house on this river. This gentleman is an extensive landholder, his personal property extends  over more than 50 square miles, which he says he purchased some 12 or 14 years ago for $800. He came here originally from the State of Ohio. He has an immense tract, stock, grain, servants &c.and raises Sugar Cane, Coffee, bannanas, Corn, and  many other things, and is the only person I see about  this section of the country making brick. During our  short stay at this pleasant rancho, Mr Thompson, one of  our party obtained a guide over the river, and proceeded out to the ancient city upon the mountain; he reports the way to be difficult and exceedingly unpleasant, but he considered himself amply repaid in beholding some of the  scattered remains of old stone walls, parts of dwellings, implements &c. I was informed in Tampico, that a large  block of stone, appearing to have been part of a monument, was raised there, with an inscription upon the under surface, below it there was another similar block, which has not yet been removed. There are many very interesting matters there for the Antiquarian: Mr  Thompson having shot a deer, returned at Sun set with it, which  was very acceptable to our company. Our party were very much annoyed by clouds of voracious moschetoes, and other exceedingly repugnant insects swarming upon all the undergrowth and weeds of this region of country. At this Haciendo, our dinners were of the best the  country afforded, including a great variety of new dishes.Tuesd 6th Day clear and very warm; our baggage was repacked and carefully weighed; and likewise assorted for mule loads. Horses, mules, and pack saddles was the business of the day Wed 7th Day clear and hot. This morning opened with the buz of preparation for marching to Mazatlan; but for many unprepared considerations, it was postponed one day. Thursd 8th Day clear and hot. Having hired our mules, mustangs and four servants from Mr Lafler, and our guide Don Francisco, being in command as director of our order of march, as interpreter, Sub Commissary &c. and our other officers being elected -- and having carefully loaded all our arms -- we commenced our line of march, -- at 10 A.M. upon an extensive levil and variegated prairie. Westward ho! all in lively spirits; the first large city to which we  looked forward with interest, was San Louis Potosi,  a distance from Tampico of about 350 miles, though variously estimated from 3 to 400 miles according to route. The appearance of our company completely equipped with with guns, rifles, revolvers, knives, swords, &c. was anything but pleasant for a guerrilla to look at, some of which we anticipated meeting. half the day we marched upon a prairie plain, a part of whichhad no timber and scarcely any vegetation. We passed a  pleasant little lake upon which there was an immense quantity of wild game, that was easily approached. in the afternoon we got among some woodland hills, with  a small allowance of very bad water. Our road was only  a very indifferent mule path, and not passible for a  vehicle of any kind, and continues thus quite to S.L. Potosi. On the way we saw immense droves of cattle and horses, roving at large upon the prairies. In the afternoon we  passed a caravan from San Louis Potosi. The road being very dusty, the sun excessively hot, water scarce and bad,  and but little available shade; we were of course quite glad to close this days journey, in camp at a small bamboo hut, on the bank of the Rio Paneuco. - and an  interesting group of dusty travellers we were too, with  a regular saw mill appetite. Freoles, or black beans, with  coffee and corn tortelias, were served round for supper, and notwithstanding they were previously out of credit; they passed very current on this occasion. Our beds and blankets were then spread at random upon the  ground in the open air; and a guard of two set, for every two hours of the night, on the first of which I served two  hourswith my comrade Mr Bods, being from 8 to 10. An early Moon rose upon the meandering and placid waters of the beautiful Rio Paneuco, and a gentle breeze played  fitfully in the overarching foliage around over camp. This was a fit time to remind one of those pleasant evenings at home, of scenes in our native land. Friday 9th Day clear & hot. Got on march before daylight and marched 9 leagues, (27 miles) through a hot sun, dusty paths, winding hither and thither over small hills and bushy plains of no peculiar interest, with no dinner  and a short allowance of very bad limestone water. This evening we anchored again a bamboo cabin, on the banks of the Rio Paneuco, very similar to the last, and found a very short allowance of provisions at  this place. A part of our party went into the river to bathe and found the water quite warm. They were cautioned  however about Alligator gars &c, which are  sometimes dangerous. We camped again in the open air. Sat 10th Day clear & hot. Commenced our march before daylight; being 7 leagues (21 miles) for the day. Travelled most of this day over plains, covered with forest of  palm trees, with dense undergrowth of palmettos.from which the palm fans are made, this change of  scenery was new and very interesting to us. It reminded  me much of the descriptions of palm forrest in Africa and  India, frequently for miles we saw no other trees than  several varieties of the palm, sometimes scattering, and  at others compact reminding one too of the Jersey pines, when seen at a distance. These palms afford but little shade, and grow here usually to the height of from 40 to 50 feet, without branches or leaves, save only upon their very summets. An American unaccustomed to such  very singular scenes cannot comprehend fully from description the majesty they impose at first sight upon the mind of the lover of the wild in Nature. View us winding our way in single file, with baggage mules in advance, with coats off, and red flannen, as  conspicuous; with arms glistening in the mid days sun, the arrearo's or mule drivers singing out with their incessant \"mulah\", the guide ahead  smoking his cigaretto, or little paper cigar, and the  rest of the travellers following like a flock of spring birds in complete tune, and merry felicity, among dust, sunshine, and the shadeless forrests of palm. [*20*] In places however the palms, and palmettos arched over our road.and gave us a partial shade for a short period, then we would come up on an open plain, followed by a regular forrest of various trees, massive, dense, and overgrown with immense vines, and peculiar trees for occasional undergrowth; next a few small hills, then a brushy plane, followed again and again with the forrests of palm. Parrots and many other birds of gay plumage were very abundant and exceedingly noisy. Here and there the grass and brush have been fired and burned off for many miles. We encamped again at a bamboo cabin on the Rio Paneuco, very similar to the last, here again most of our party bathed in the river. I saw some diminutive watermellons at this Rancho, and helped to taste one. Our fare at this place was reasonable, but charges superior. The water is still very indifferent and strong of limestone. 11th Day clear and hot. Started early for a Rancho on the  Tamouin & Paneuco. 9 leagues (27 miles) The scenery of this day was much diversified and interesting with palms, plains, hills, gullies, brushes, and forrests. Among which I saw very many curious Banyan trees, or the wild figg tree. So curious were they, that if time had permitted I should have, certainlysketched a number of them. I think it is the same species of the Banyan tree of India. I saw several  cases of palm trees completely imbedded in the very trunks of immense Banyan trees, and being quite ornamental  to it. This tree returns from its from its branches direct  in a perpendicular line very frequently to the ground  in long cords like ropes, which take root and spring up again, in many shapes and sizes, and in many  cases more than a hundred times from one large tree. On this days march we saw several curious Mounds. We arrived at the Tamowin about 3.P.M, and after sending all baggage over with ourselves in [a] canoes,  we finished our crossing by swimming the horses & mules,  on the opposite bank we encamped at a large and  good looking Rancho, being at the junction of the  rivers Paneuco and Tamowin. Here we purchased a calf of good size for $.3.00, and prepared him accordingly, for further use upon the way. Water still unpalatable. This evening a part of our company were in to swim again. From circumstances we inferred trouble with guerrillas, but the guards were vigilant, and we left at 1.O.clock next  morning winding over way through a forest by moonlight.Mond. 12th Day clear & hot. Proceeded by early moonlight (1.O. clock) on our way for Villa de Viase. At sunrise we arrived at the first- Mountain on our way called the \"Siera Madre\" or Mother Mountain. Before entering the pass, the traveller will find a valuable warm Sulpher Spring, of great medicinal properties not far from the path. As you approach the pass, the scene is peculiar. You walk and lead your Mustangs over a rocky path, of such barbarous rudeness that you may deem it a venture for a Mountain goat, and yet your horse must be taxed with all his personal wits to puzzle his way out over loose rocks that edge over the precipice of an almost bottomless uncertainty. The mules, -they are as sharp as Chatham Yankees, for they will carry a load, where a common man would want room to tout over his own shadow. They are perfect baggage wild cats, and climb rocks with heavy loads as if they had claws, or were cammels in the desert of Arabia. We passed over one high and exceedingly dangerous precipice,  and other unpleasant places, and finally passed through a very narry and precipitous valley that meandered like the bed of a little river diagonally across the mountain, with almost the slightgrade of a rail road, and generally not much over 300 feet in width, but steep and of great height with timber on each side edging up the mountains, the meanderings of this cavern-valley  with its hight cliffs, and little coves and passes, gave to the whole scene a peculiar wildness and Sublimity. We scared up five young deer among the rocks; It was in this mountain pass that from report, we first  anticipated some Mexican Indians, or Guerillas; in this pass they could sweep and be safe; and although our guns were several times fired, none made their appearance to us. After crossing the mountain pass, we came upon an undulating country still uninhabited, though in many places of a very rich soil, covered sometimes with good timber and now and then prarie grass, with occasional barrens of wild and cavernous limestone rocks. Entrances to caves are to be seen, and in one place a romantic spot, an immense well of an oval form descends perpendicularly through limestone rocks to a great debth. Some ancient trees bend gracefully over and around its mouth. To day also, I found the remains of an ancient town and the appearance of an ancient fort on our way to the village de Viase. Revd Mr Woods and myself passed on in the advance of the trainMarch, 1849.  a mile or two, with the view of arriving at the village in  advance of the train. on the way just as we had pas a  slight bend of the road, we saw five uncouth looking Mexicans sitting on the bank of a dry creek; the wispered suspiciously until we came beside them, when they all arose at once with sticks, and gathered around us, supposing something rong on foot, I drew my gun from its sheath, and exhibited also my revolver and knife. Mr Woods prepared himself also by exarming his gun &c. These fellows followed us a short distance evidently meditating our arms, when they fell  off from us on being told that many Americans were just behind. We arrived in the village early in the afternoon, and found Mr Grants division just on the point of leaving for S.L. Potosi. This being the place where all our horses had to be shod for the mountains to come. We encamped on the village plaza, pitched our tents, prepared our own food, &c. Tuesd 13th Day hot and clear, examined the appearance of the village with friends, and obtained a good bowl of coffee two eggs and bread on the plaza for 1 Real, 12 1/2 cts. We have discovered that  Milk, Eggs, freeoles, tortelias, Oranges, and Coffee may be  readily obtained at almost every place; all of which  are very cheap, except coffee. On the Plaza of thisvillage there stands the remains of an Ancient Catholic Church. The Cupola is yet in a tollerable State of preservation and 3 bells yet hang in it of a very Anti- quated appearance. Upon its summet shrubs, cactus, grass may be seen as luxuriant as upon Terra firma. Vide sketch No 5. To the right of it is a long bamboo  building thatched with palmetoes; in it the Catholic citizens hold their Service. From appearances within we judge this chappel to contain more real wealth than many of those magnificent edifices of the States. This day was occupied in Shoeing our horses. Mr. Lafler of Tampico came in the village some 90 miles from his Rancho in order to have them properly attended too, the Shoes having been brought here from Tampico. The price of Shoeing here is from 3 to 5 dollars per horse, in the States about one dollar. Here they most generally throw the animal upon the  ground and tie him there with ropes. The Smith shops and other mechanical departments appear more like burlesques than the representation of a half civilized people. This morning I ascended the cupola of the plaza ruins and then beheld a beautiful view of the Siera Madre Mountains 12 miles westward as in Sketch No. 6.The foreground from the mountain was nearly a levil plane, intersperced here and there with apparent clearings, which in several cases proved to be small open and natural praries, probably never cleared by the hand of man, as they were not much used. A small rapid and romantic river passes under a deep bluff beside the village, where our party were again into bathe, as the day was excessively hot and the water agreeable. The peaks of the Siera Alta, appeared like a cloud in the distance. In offering a pass to the  traveller these mountains are very high and formidable. Just as I had completed this sketch the priest of the parish a very pleasant man ascended the tower and expressed much pleasure at finding me sketching, and thereupon requested me to descend and dine with him, to which I complied with much pleasure, in descending the tower in a shady recess, he placed my arms around  himself he also embraced me, with much feeling, and said that he liked the Americans. His dinner was served  up in the best Mexican style, with wine and numerous new dishes, served in about 8 or10 changes of plates. I left much gratified with his hospitality. Our horses being in readiness, at 4.P.M. we commenced our marchtoward the foot of the Siera Madre Mountains. In leaving and crossing the river by the ford, it was very gratifying to see about 90 or 100 Mexicans upon the high bluffs and along the road to see us out and bid us a friendly adieu, and Adios, adios, adios, was echoed here, there and yonder, which signifies - \"to God\"- we commend you. We travelled some 10 miles this evening and camped in a wild spot about 2 miles from the foot of the mountain. My sketchbook, a satchell, and a coat belonging to Mr Sayre, were lost after dark before camping, but 3 of us returned by moonlight before sun rise and found them. Our camp fire looked really interesting this evening with the sentinals parading around the sleepers who where rolled  up in blankets; who constantly watched among the timbers and bushes for enemy and wholves, the latter of which made themselves known before daylight. [*Wedn 14th.*] Day hot & clear. Arose before before daylight and proceeded to the Siera Madre Mountain. As we ascended, I observed numerous scattering mounds, parts of old walls &c, the timber became large and dense. I believe that there is a spring (the only one from Tampico to S Louis Potosi) not far from the road to the right as you ascend the mountain.our path over the mountain was in ascent by windings about 3 miles, and nearly the same in descending over the opposite side and other hills. The whole scenery was wild beyond description. Could this road or path be exhibited in a civilized country, it would be considered dangerous even for a mountain goat; how then shall I describe it, when a painter would consider it beyond a just representation if skillfully drawn. We lead our horses up the  steep precipitous masses, jumping and scrambling from  rock to rock sometimes two feet perpendicularly. The most ragged and cragged ledges, holes, chasms, and peaks that  the mind could picture for feats in horsemanship. Reader! you have doubtless seen nominally bad roads in the States, but they convey only a faint idea of the  hardships you must encounter in passing the formidable crags upon these mountains of distracted rudeness. Having surmounted the first Series, we descended upon  similar sharp and pointed edges into a wild and  romantic cove, leading off over and around other more  passable hills, in full view of numerous mountains ranging at random in every direction, until we reached the Ranch la Pier, by a small lakeupon a beautiful plane, and here we encamped for the night, having arrived early in the afternoon. The proprietor of the Rancho, is an Alcalde of wealth, and a man of affable manners. Before sun set we ascended a neighboring hill and sketched scene No. 7. including a large assemblage of distant mountains. The setting sun cast back their shadows upon the planes, as I descended, and lent a passing beauty to them ever to be remembered. From advice given us by the Alcalde, it was thought advisable to change our rout over the mountains to San Louis Potosi, by a nearer and more safe direction. The Mexican forces, and Indians or Guerrillas, being  upon the regular route, which would cause us trouble. The first division having gone that way unadvised, they met with difficulties, detention, and considerable danger. Thurs 15th Day clear & hot. Entered upon the nearer route, and passed palm forrests, old fortifications, and a fine little river, where  we filled our canteens with refreshing and cool water, the best from Tampico, and accomplished a long march and 6 or 7 formidable mountains of worse paths than any previously travelled. To describe our labours on these volcanic rocks of gothic masonry, would be romantic indeed.but suffice it to be said that this days march was  the most wild rugged and exhausting of any to San Louis Potosi. On this route I had the pleasure of discovering a  magnificent cavernous Amphitheatre of several thousand feet in diameter, and about 300 feet in perpendicular  debth, covered below with dense timber, and overhung with high arching cliffs of great magnificence. Our mountain scenery today was exceedingly grand though we enjoyed it but little owing to the difficult passes to be encountered. Many of the mountains had no timber, nor even vegetation upon them; being vast masses of rude brown rocks particularly upon their summets. Had time permitted, I should have sketched some of these alpine scenes of barrenness for the information and curiosity of my friends and readers. They are totally unlike anything I ever before saw  in point of complete barrenness and appeared really savage. At sunset we descended into a romantic valley and wound around several Sugarloaf hills, by dark into the beautiful village of San Nicholas, where we encamped upon a pleasant plaza of grass in the midst of the village and at the foot of a large and imposing mountain.but suffice it to be said that this days march was the most wild rugged and exhausting of any to San Louis Potosi.

Whilst watering our horses at a pond in this valley, two suspicious Mexicans appeared, one over the pond, and the other near us apparently examining our arms, &c. and in a short time one of them made bold to tell two of our party that  he was one of a party defeated by the Mexican Government, and that they were many, who were now in persuit of  plunder, both of them were handsomely dressed, and rode upon first class animals. We turned to the left from this interesting valley, through a pass in the hills similar to  No 9. when we came in view of the beautiful and-- romantic village of Tortugas, or village of turtles, where we arrived at 4 P.M. and located ourselves in a  small brush school house, upon a small riding ground well adapted to defence, as an attack of the Guerrillas was looked for, as quite certain during the night. Many of the inhabitants collected around us with curiosity and pleasure, as they hoped we would be of service to them in case of an attack of the Guerrillas or robbers. We were all in anticipation of a fight, when we saw a small fire upon the summit of a neighboring mountain, supposed to be a signal light. Guns, pistols &c were allwith here and there patches of stunted vegetation, growing among the wild mountain rocks. Among these I saw a number of strange and interesting trees, curious plants, magueys, palmettoes, coco's, and a strange fruit resembling the pine apple, being twice as large, and filled with numerous small soft white fruits, much resembling in appearance and taste the common chesnut, which were very abundant on one of the mountains. I also saw a shrub or bean plant bearing flowers, resembling skeins of white & red silk, from 1 to 2 inches in thickness, and from 4 to 6 inches in length. On this days march we passed through many very peculiar mountains, scenes of interest. No 9 (sketch.) was taken on horseback whilst passing into the valley of corn. No 10. is a view of the Valle de Maise, or valley of corn, looking to the north. This valley is about one mile in width, and many in length. The hills upon either side are nothing of nearly void of vegetation, the whole valley is divided into large fields for corn, and well improved with stone fences. The soil is rich and corn flourishes here luxuriantly. Far on the northern horizon a high mountain wasall of which grew from 4 to 15 feet in height, and chiefly among the interstices of the rocks. It appeared to be a  section of country almost useless for any purpose, and it  really appeared strange, how such a barren wilderness of  of thorns could be at all inhabited where water was  also very bad and scarce; in the afternoon we travelled among clouds of dust, with a hot sun and but little breeze. before sunset we encamped under a tree, beside, a desolate mud dwelling upon a deasert plane, much like a scene in the desert of Arabia, appearing quite as barren and  forlorn, as the immagination could well picture as in sketch No 13. A large old fashioned rope and pulley well, was in the  vicinity, at which about 40 Mexican women, were engaged in drawing water, and carrying it away in large earthen jars upon their heads, bearing a striking resemblance to the old Egyptian costoms, in dress, color, and manners. At this place we fared slim and paid well for it. Sund 18th   Day clear and warm. Proceeded on our journey at 6.A.M. very  anxious to get out of this barren and sandy wilderness. and travelled nearly all day over diversified planes of  limestone, palms, maguays, casters, some timber, and for a  mile or two, for the first time a woodland of beautiful cedars.put in the best order, our camp fire put out, and two guards put on duty. The Alcalde paid us a friendly visit, and many of the inhabitants brought us cheap provissions, and the night passed off without trouble. [*Sat. 17th.*] Day clear and warm. The inhabitants came in numbers to bid us a friendly adios. I pencil'd sketches No 11. and 12. just before leaving showing on No 11. our position in camp at the school house, and an opposite view looking South. Oranges flourish here, and are  very cheap, eggs are plentiful, with many useful articles of provissions. Soon after leaving this pleasant village, we ascended several large and barren hills, and in a few hours descended a very romantic pass down upon prarie plains and cultivated fields. our views on this days journey were extensive new diversified and interesting. We came to a  small village of a very romantic appearance, beside a little stream of water, where at first the inhabitants were much terrified at our appearance. We saw but little timber, during the whole day, the planes and  hills, being almost covered with wild cactus, prickley pears, and the short scrubby palms, etc.At intervals for several miles, the ground was as white as the very snow of a northern winter, having a saline taste, in places, in others that of Epsom Salts, and as fine as the very best flour. Caverns were beneath, for we  could often hear the footsteps of our horses echoing beneath, and now and then a chasm or deep pit would  appear. When timber appeared in the usual form of groups or clusters, it usually had a singular appearance, much resembling extensive Apple, and  Peach orchards. The country had conspicuous marks of a volcanic origin upon a limestone foundation. We were almost constantly in sight of distant ranges of lofty and rugged mountains, lending romance to the day. and now and then large planes, covered with prairie grass would extend for before the eye to the mountains skirted here and there with pleasant shady woodlands. We arrived at the Hacienda about 4. P.M. and were  gratified to find it a place much superior to the last,  not only for provisions, but also for shade and comfort. About 9.O.clock this morning we arrived at a place on the valley plane, where a stream of clear and very strong limestone water meandered from a small lake, and in a short distancedisappeared beneath the ground; this water though clear and cold, was so strongly impregnated with the Carbonate of lime, that though we were very thirsty, we could scarcely drink it. During a temporary halt, I sketch'd this lake No. 12 [*14*], and its vicinity southward. Game was plentiful here, and  several of our party delay'd some on account of it. Mr Sherman, one of the same , remained there so long that  in persuit of our caravan he missed the path and  was lost for a day and a half suffering greatly from exposure and other great dangers; after some delay, expense,  and trouble in scouring the country in various directions with a Mexican guide, he was at last found, much fatigued frightened, and sick, having encountered considerable perils. I remained some time behind the company in waiting for  Sherman, as long as I felt it safe from missing the way  myself, expecting him to come up upon this path, [during that time I sketched scene No 14. a high] on our right there was a high mountain [to] [the North] bearing the marks of a large volcano. Some of our party were in to bathe again this evening, but as our journey has elevated us much, the water is now becoming cooler especially each night, which is cold enough for two or three blankets, whilst  the mid day sun is quite hotMond 19th Day warm and clear. Proceeded on our journey at 7.O. clock. sMuch of this days journey was very similar to the last, at times winding among barren hills, small planes of cactus, thorns scattering palms, gullies and rocks, with small groves of peculiar trees of a stunted growth. Before sun set we crossed a beautiful and fertile plane under cultivation with corn, and haulted for a short time at a large well on one of the fields one and a half liles from, and in full view of the beautiful little town of Ceretus de San Juan; at the suburbs of which we encamped within a large yard for the  night. Before day light had left the hills of Ceretus, I passed through several parts of the town, and Sketched the church and plaza as in No 15. Showing the valley and hills eastward, over which we had passed during the after part of the day. The appearance of this little town is quite genteel the houses being mostly constructed of Stone and frequently whitewashed and as often secluded in pleasant Shady yards and groves of the trees and shrubs peculiar to this country.Tuesd 20th  Day warm and clear. Proceeded on our journey at 6.O.clock. Just as we were leaving the yard the horse belonging to Mr Thompson, taking fright at some object ran off through the yard, and brok his rifle into many small pieces, Mr T.--escaping unhurt. About 1 mile from  Ceretus, looking westward, I sketched scene No 16. showing the barren hills, a hacienda to the right, and the little clusters of bushes, dotting the ground like miniature islands. We were among the hills and ravines all day, and passed up one very interesting pass between barren mountains which was several  miles in length. On the way before entering this pass,  and at the commencement of a fine broad road, we  halted for a short time at a large Hacienda, called San  E Pedro No 17. having westward a beautiful mountain view, south the cultivated fields and distant hills, and around the dwelling several beautiful groves, over the principal door was painted in large letters, \"Casa Particular\". It being a public house or hotel of the  Mexican order. Having ascended through peculiar scenes of the passes, to the summet of the mountains, we then passed a long time over a wild rocky and entirely desolatewilderness, almost entirely destitute of the smallest vegetation, except in some particular spots, where small stone & mud huts of misery were now and then to be seen. Before descending we passed a small mud village in a little rocky and desolate ravine; with only a few cactus, thorns, and stunted brush, but no regular timber about it. It looked much like solitude and misery. The road has now become excellent, and for the first time we found it graded and paved as a regular road up the mountain. Wooden crosses are plentiful and conspicuous, they are more numerous now than on the way back to Tampico; Sometimes two or three in sight of each other may be seen and particularly on this days march. We are told that these crosses are erected upon the particular spots, where travelers have been murdered. if so, this is decidedly a great country. As we descended the mountain, winding our way down a dangerous pass, a beautiful plane, with a range of barren mountains 15 miles westward, appeared before us, which I hastily sketched as our party descended to the plane, as in number 18. This plane is about 15 miles in width, and almost entirely covered with a brush peculiar to this country.This plane, of the valley is quite level and of very great length, the camino that crosses it, is at least 100 feet broad, and would be an elegant road for travel if not so abundantly supplied with dust and sand. Our party were so much enveloped in dust, that during a portion of the time some of them were not distinguishable at the distance of a few rods. Clouds of dust arose high in the air, and marked in places the spots where persons were moving on many parts of the plane. Such scenes have however been long familiar to us from the very city of Tampico. At sun set we arrived at the \"Meson De Fern\" a public house called Pestelius located in a desert of sand, a few miles from a village to the north west and off from the road. At this place, we found Capt Grants' division of the Camargo Company, who met us in a sociable manner as old friends, the two divisions having taken different roads to San Louis Potosi.. Mr Chevallias' party of 5 having also arrived the whole Camargo Company were again together. At night, a high wind arose and gave us a complete storm of dust, exceeding anything of the kind that I have ever before witnessed in any country, reminding one of the desert of Arabia.Wednd 21st Day warm and clear. Capt. Grants division, left before sunrise in order to reach San Louis Potosi before night. Our company proceeded on the way an hour after, as we did not design pressing our horses and mules with a very long days march. Nos 19 and 20 are exterior and  interior views of the desert house where we camped. To the right of the house, there is a large well, which is deserving of notice; two or three hoses are fastened by beams to a vertical shaft, which by 8 right angle sticks move a horizontal beam, to which there is a wheel about 12 feet in diameter, with ropes and  about 20 leather buckets, for raising water from the  well to a trough, and from thence into a stone bason  about 60 feet square, and 8 or 10 feet in debth. This water was fair and cool, and very desirable for the country. Such wells are not frequent, and found only occasionally at the large Haciendo's or Ranchoe's of the wealthy. Water on this road from Tampico to  San Louis Potosi, is scarce, and in almost every instance very unpalatable, muddy, and dangerous to the stranger. It is therefore nescessary for travellers to be cautious in drinking the water along this route                                                                      in particular. This days journey was very similar to the last, with hills and dusty roads, with a hot sun, brushy planes, thorns, and large cactus of various forms, &c. Mountains of barren rocks were seen all day, but we travelled chiefly upon the planes. About 4 in the afternoon we arrived at the Rancho de los Soledad, previous to which I sketched scene No. 21 as we descended to the valley in which this rancho is located, This plane is very wide, and a very considerable length, on this plane about 30 miles to the left is located the city of San Louis Potosi, in full view of large Mountains, though not within several miles of any of them. No. 22 is a sketch of the Haciendo or \"Rancho de los  Solidad\", and its neighboring mountain, which I sketched before sun set, this scene is looking S. East. We encamped opposite to this in a large Mud wall with appartments for travellers as in Sketch No. 23. The inhabitants are now becoming less friendly than they were back over the mountains. And are decidedly against the Americans in the popular feeling, and have occasionally expressed those feelings with insults, and a few words of contempt, which some of them have learned from the American deserters, in the English language. We have seen a number of these contempitible shadows of white men and almost as often heard their curses, or indecent language, but we have generally left them unnoticed. At this rancho we saw a large amount of arms and lances, with an American Rifle, pistols, swords &c which led us to suspicion the character of the place strongly; we however kept our Arms and Sentinels in good trim, and were ready at the word, to show them that in defence we were the same original Americans that they might have before read about. Had our numbers been small enough to suit their taste, I have no doubt but that a fight would have resulted judging from all circumstances, questions, &c. Being in the neighborhood of S. L. Potosi, it is now absolutely nescessary to be constantly on your gard for all shapes of thieves, Robbers, Guerillos, &c., etc, etc. who appear to compose a large proportion of the population. [*Thursd 22nd*]  We left the Rancho, this morning at 3. O. clock for San  Louis Potosi, the road was broad, and lined with cactus, from 5 to 15 feet in height. We were all awake for any attack on the way. Having travelled 15 miles by 1/2 past 8.O. clock A.M. we entered the Splendid and singular city of San Louis Potosi, having passed through a beautiful little village before entering Potosi. The city is situated upon a large and beautiful plane, which is under good cultivation, and is for several miles in every direction; divided into regular right angle  \"streets and roads. The fences of the roads, if they may be so called are composed of the high pentangular cactus, growing in single stems of about 5 inches diameter to a  height of about 8, 10, or 15 feet, and frequently so close together that it is generally capable of shutting out the smallest animal. The average width of the streets are about 30 feet. A member of large and handsome species of trees range along them, with which I am not familiar, one of which resembles in bark, limb, and  site, the Locust, with leaf of a small fern. Another, has the shape and height of a poplar, with the denseness of the black thorn hedges of the States; it is a  beautiful tree of a dark green color, and very ornamental. The maguay is another peculiar plant, very abundant here; I have seen fences made of them extending many miles at a time, and very common everywhere  onour way from Tampico. All these interesting plants, trees &c. with a large number that would be  difficult to describe, but which nevertheless are exceedingly beautiful, belong to this country and are so abundant as at times to cover many miles in compact masses, so much so that it would be difficult for a man to pass among them as they all, with but little exception possess luxuriant crops of  thorns. All these species crowd the roads and surround the fields as you pass into San Louis Potosi. I also for the first time saw two peach trees in full blossom in a beautiful garden at the suburbs of the city. And many beautiful flowers of singular beauty were in full bloom likewise and filled the air with the richness of their morning fragrance. Several fine fields of ripe barley added to the view, their mellow orange hues, whilst, the plough (a rude woodden concern) was busy beside. The Orange, Lemons, and fig trees were also handsome when blended with their fruits, beneath other more conspicuous trees, among which was one called the Peru, another the China tree, andyet another larger and decorated with more exquisite brilliance than I have ever before witnessed. all these with their charming colors and luxuriance bent gracefully over our dusty roads as we passed into the great central metropolis of Potosi. The morning sun had already arrisen upon the domes, towers and minarets of Potosi, as our company entered it from the North. There was so much of the grand and the humble combined, that I could not but remark its resemblance to what I had read of St Petersburg and Moscow, as described by travellers in Russia. After wending in single file our tortuous way amid dense crowds of strange brown faces, around the various streets of the city we at last took up our quarters at the St Anthony house, which was commodious and  constructed strictly after the Mexican order, and one of the first hotels in the city, though, not by any means adapted to the ideas of Americans, being very similar to sketches Nos. 19. and 20. The suburbs of the city (which are very extensive) are almost entirely composed of miserable looking one story flat roof'd mud dwellings of a dilapidated appearance which are much inferior to  the [*34*]very lowest order of dwellings found in any part of the  States, and contrast in a very striking manner with the numerous splendid sanctuaries, public buildings, towers, domes, and superfluous grandeur of the interior city. None of our company even dreamed of the surprising splendours, which broke so suddenly upon them, when they entered the thronged plazas amid the thousands of vacant gazers who seem'd to view us as some unearthly intruders, just draft among them from some other plannet. Our ideas were never so much unhinged at when too closely crowded by dense throngs of starving Mexicans, who with wondrous eyes and  open mouths, Knew not in decency where to end their extravagant curiosity. As we entered the  streets were quick ly thronged, the windows and  iron gratings filled with Seniorettas or Ladies, the doors with wise heads and muchatcha's of boys with some upon the very house tops, to the  Americans enter into the precincts of their almost forbidden walls of China. An unfriendly feeling towards the Americans was soon evident from their language  as it was a day of religious ceremonies, and rest from labor, the church and plaza was thronged, by Mexicans dressed in their holliday best. We passed through this pleasant town, without halting and ascended a steep, high and rugged mountain at the immediate suburbs of the town. On looking back towards Amattitan, distant 14  miles to the South east and Tekelah at its base I hastily sketched the view as in No 59. On ascending this mountain I saw an animal of the Lizard Species about 2 feet in  length lying upon a large boulder rock in a ravine. After ascending we passed several miles through a  a deep, [and] very narrow, and crooked ravine among the highland hills; it was perfectly adapted to the purposes of Ladrones or Robbers, and has been recently the theatre of bloody deeds, robberies, &c. Here jet black Quartz began to appear plentiful after passing in single file for Several miles under the arches and bluffs of this wild and narrow ravine, we descended into a small and pretty valley, where there was a small farm, green fields and some water, from  this we ascended large hills, almost composed of  [*35*]the same brittle jet black quartz, before named. So much so, that it was hard upon the feet of our animals, we again descended into a gently sloping valley of about two miles in width, at the far northern end of which we could see the interesting Lake of Madalena, which I sketched on a nearer approach as in No 60. Showing the town of Madalena on the margin of the Lake, beyond which that welcome sheet of water with its interesting mountain scenery appeared, reminding one much of similar scenes in Italy and Switzerland; and rather unlike many other Mexican towns. At this place we stopped in a comfortable mason overnight, halting about 4 P.M. An opportunity offering I went and upon the margin of the lake and sketched view No 61 looking west among the mountains over which the sun was setting. Also No 62 looking south east towards part of the town Madalena is a town of a shady and pleasant appearance. Most of its streets are narrow and crooked, but well shaded in general. The plaza, was of good size and had a fine large antiquated church upon the south eastern side of it. Around which there was a large crowd of worshippers,uncivil manners, and in two of our party being stoned upon the city plaza; all of which we readily discovered and were particularly cautious, in being upon our guard, whilst we were frequently rendering civilities for incivilities. To these however we are happy to state that there were a number of exceptions, among the higher classes, and the better informed, which gave us a better opinion of Potosi, than we otherwise should  have had. We were nearly three days in this interesting city during which time whilst our guide was preparing fresh mustangs &c for our further journey to Mazatlan; and having some opportunities, I availed myself of them in visiting and sketching some of the massive and beautiful churches &c, having first obtained permission from an alcalde's clerk in the Governors' Palace, to visit and sketch as I wish'd. I proceeded in company with an American friend about 1 1/2 miles south from  the city, towards the Mosa Mountain, where from the remains of an old mud fort, I sketched the domes  &c of the city as in No 24. nearly all of which belong to magnificent churches erected many years past by the Spaniards at enormous costs, and decorated  in theinterior with gorgeous and the most exhorbitant displays of wealth and splendour that the human immagination could well conceive of, and far exceeding any thing of the kind to be found in the States. An open plane of more than a mile in extent each way extended between the fort and the city, upon which several hundred Mexican soldiers were exercising with targets, drilling &c. At this time large forces are concentrated here, who appear to be preparing for political struggles for power. To the right of this open plane, there are four parallel rows of the beautiful Alamo trees forming a shady and a very pleasant walk of about one mile from the city proper southward to the front  of the magnificent sanctuary (Santoario) as in fig 25. At each end and along this walk there are handsomely ornamented fountains. No 25 is a view of the Sanctuary and Mosa Mountains from the same position, where fig 24 was taken. A nearer view of the Sanctuary was then taken from the front near a fountain, as in fig 26, including two fountains two neat gardens, and the style of seats surrounding the principal fountain. The workmanship upon this magnificent edifice appears to be a contribution of the various orders ofArchitecture which in execution I believe to be superior to any thing similar which I have seen in the States. Not even excepting Trinity Church in New York, and composed of a hard red sand stone very similar to the one named. This church though over a mile from the city was under military guard, from whom I asked permission to enter but was told that the chief key of the Sanctuary was in the posession of the Captain, who was out drilling his  men upon the plane beforementioned. On returning to the city we passed a number of handsome edifices of  singular and antiquated appearance, but my opportunities limited me in sketching many of them. The streets were thronged in almost every direction, and should one attempt a sketch in their presence, a crowd of noisy gabbling superstitious men, women, and children, would soon compell a retreat, at the risk of being stoned, amid the jeers, and language suiting degraded and grossly ignorant minds. I was told there were over fifty handsome Sanctuaries or churches in this city, which from appearances I doo not doubt. None but the Catholic religion is tolerated here as in other parts of the Republic, and in passing each Sanctuary, even upon the opposite side of the street, the person is required to takeoff his hat, and retain it in his hand, until he has passed the door of the Sanctuary, otherwise he is liable to be stoned at the shortest notice; if nothing worse may happen him. I'm entering the church during service he is required to kneel, and to accompany respectfully in the ceremonies of the church. The interior splendors of these numerous churches, I could not describe in justice within my present compass. Their displays are gorgeous in the highest degree of man's ingenuity; and frequently exhibit much of the Theatrical; in some instances the walls and high gothic roof, being entirely covered with thousands of gothic (relief) devices, are entirely gilt with gold or silver leaf, until the whole interior glitters like a solid golden palace, with richly ornamental chandaliers, lights of various colors, hundreds of Statues of life size, adorned in robes of brilliant colors, gems, in great profusion, magnificent organs, select gallaries for the paintings, relicts, and statues of the saints, in one apartment of the St Domingo Sanctuary I was shown the bones of saints, and such other things as would fill a volume to describe.On returning to the main plaza, I sketched the Palace  of the governor as in fig 27. a crowd of noisy belligerents soon manifested a a jeering aspect, which compelled me  to finish my sketch rather hastily. I then passed off hastily until I had eluded the noisy crowd of  ignorammus's and by permission getting upon the  roof of a house. I sketched therefrom the beautiful  and very extensive Sanctuary of \"San Francisco\" as in  fig 28. showing its domes, cupolas, and spires as it appeared from the North east corner. Its bells  are numerous of many tones, and remarkably fine; the  interior like an immense museum, is crowded, with  wealth, and splendours beyond description. It has  as near as I can judge over, one thousand apartments,   a part of which are very elegant in their styles, guildings,  statues, paintings, stuccoed works, altars, tombs, vaults,  organs, galleries, painted domes, stained glass, chandeliers, massive gilt gothic works &c. &c. It covers a large  square, and is almost a royal city of itself. I after proceeded  to the Church and College of St. Josephs, which I  sketched as in No 29. My visits also extended to the magnificent  Sanctuary of St. Domingo, the front of which wasGuarded by a large mounted Cannon, and in a house, beside it several hundred soldiers. The interior of this great  church was the most gorgeous I ever beheld, its walls  and gothic ceiling was so gilt with gold leaf, as to appear  like one immense golden gothic palace. The Captain  of this division politely accompanied me through the  church, explaining its sacred relicts, &c. Among which  I saw immages of Angels, about 4 feet in height appearing to be cast of Gold, encased in splendid cases over  the grand Altar. A similar image of the Virgin  and Saviour sitting upon a throne of very massive  silver clouds, over which was an immense dome  inlaid with porcelain of rich colors. There was A large and  beautiful Organ upon a highly ornamented gallery, resting  upon Lions, that seemed watching the congregation,  And numerous saints in richest robes, (of nearly full  size) were to be seen in every direction. The interior  forum of the church was that of a cross, having two  magnificent Altars. I asked permission to sketch this  fine church from the little plaza front, but was  told that it could not be granted, without a  special permit. I then proceeded to sketch theyards, with numbered cells, in which from 10 to 30 may sleep on a brick pavement, having their own blankets of course. There is usually a cook shop in one of these cells, called a \"Fonda,\" where coffee, meat &c. are prepared to order, and usually well charged for; although the cooking may be very inferior to any thing in the States. In chocolate, however, the Mexicans excel, and sometimes in coffee, and especially in light sweet cakes. March  25th.  (Sunday)  Our company (of between 40 and 50,)  Left San Louis Potosi this morning at half past five, in double file presenting to the gazing crowds quite a military face, as red flannel was very conspicuous on almost every man, for almost every coat was off, it being clear moderately warm, and very dusty for a time. In the distance the city appeared beautiful and interesting. We soon entered upon open and barren rolling hills, where I found several handsome specimens of agate scattered among gravel. I neither heard of, or saw any of the silver mines of this State, though I believe them to exist in Durango, Zacatecas, and the state of San Louis Potosi, as large silver trains pass down to Tampico from this country, every few weeks. [*38A*]about 10 miles from San Louis, we entered upon some very rocky hills, into deep ravines, several narrow vallies and through narrow passes, with a cross here and there at short intervals, marking the spot where some traveller has been murdered, and his remains, if poor, deposited beneath. Our company was composed of over 40 American two Spanish guides, 8 Arrearos' or mule drivers, (Mexican) and 14 pack mules to carry our baggage allowing 150lbs. to each mule in order to travel with speed and safety. Our guns, pistols, swords, knives, &c. were all ready for immediate use, and were kept in excellent order, and many of our boys made the vallies echo with their jovial songs whilst passing, at the same time keeping an eye for any vagrant Guerrillas among the cliffs and brushes. One of the narrow vallies through which we passed during this day was peculiarly romantic, whilst a broad creek filling nearly the width of this valley of precipices, meandered with it; the bed of this creek, was in most places almost dry, so that we travelled some miles upon beds of gravel. At one place, on passing up the side of a precipitous, volcanic hill, I saw a very great quantity of handsome Geods of Calcedony, scatteredchief plaza looking eastward, including the fountain The Parroquia, a fine church, and a small part of   St Domingo east of it. A crowd of idle male and female spectators soon assembled around me bobbing continually their ugly phiz's directly in my face, so as interrupt, and intercept the view I was sketching -- presently two officers in military uniform, arrested me, and proceedded with me to an Alcalde's office, at the left base of the Governors' Palace. He wished to know  if I had a permit to sketch, I informed him that I had from the Praefectas' Clerk; upon which he discharged me and sent an officer (in uniform) to accompany me to my former seat on the Plaza, who stood by me with drawn sword, and like a gallant man kept men, women, and boys, at full bey, until I had finished my task, when he left me with a polite bow, &c. No 30, represents that sketch on the chief plaza. This plaza is almost always densely crowded by  all grades and classes of people, who stare as much as Americans, as though they were Bedouin Arabs; No 31. is a red sand stone fountain, which I sketched in the Southern port of the city at the head of the Allamo                                           walk before described.It is much of the time crowded by visitors for water, No 32. is the chief market plaza; upon this plaza are numerous Doric pillars, well finished from red sand rock, it is intended in time to place a roof upon them so as to shelter the market to be held therein. This view is looking north, at the present time the markets are held around the principal building. A good cup of coffee can be had here for a Mordeau 6 1/4 ct and mellons with many other things proportionably cheap. At this date 25th March, water mellons &c. are plentiful and cheap; the markets appeared flush with delicious fruits, oranges, mellons, cantelopes, bannannas, &c. etc; but no apples or peaches; no walnuts, chesnuts, or hickory nuts, yet similar though better than the market of Tampico. The scenery about San Louis Potosi is in places romantic and interesting when combined with the distant mountain scenery of the Southwest; the contrast of mud huts with splendid edifices and the superb residences of the wealthy are very striking and is the first thing to be observed by every traveller. At this place, they are decidedly hostile to theAmericans, partly I presume from the late war and in part from religious education. At evening the  Host, or priests, pass around in a fine carriage, drawn by mules; before which a number are seen walking, each carrying his candle, whilst several small bells, are tinkling to the heavy toll of deep tone'd bells of the Sanctuary every person male, female, young & old, must Kneel to  the host whilst passing This is a strict religious  ceremony, the nonobservance of which brings at once  upon the head of the disobedient immediate dangers  either in being stoned, or possibly something worse,  besides inculcating the ill will of the observers. In  San Louis, though there are English, French, and  some Americans, yet they are much more strict  in Religious observances than in Tampico, and  Americans should be more on their guard in  passing into the interior of Mexico and westward. As near as I could ascertain, the population of  San Louis Potosi, is about 75 thousand. The proportion of which are illitterate Mexicans of the Indian  race, called Mexican Indians. They are usually clothed  indifferently, live similar in mud huts, upon mud  floors, andlead a servile life, or one of complete indolence. Our Company remained 3 days in San Louis in order to purchase some fresh Animals, shoe others, and prepare for our further progress to Mazatlan. The two divisions with others joined in order to leave Potosi together, so as to make a display of arms, as we were informed that 70 armed guerrillas had preceeded us to the mountain passes in order to rob us, as it was currently reported here that we were in posession of a large amount of gold, and going to California to remain. It is well known that a large population of robbers live in San Louis Potosi, whose chief business is to watch and rob travellers, which makes robberies every day affairs in this country. The Mexican Indian population of this part of the Republic, seeing the monopolies of the government, have rebelled and endeavored to first down the present government with that pretext, and at the same time committing gross outrages and robberies under that cloak, by themselves. I am not aware of any Hotel in the American style existing in the whole city of San Louis, Masons or public houses exist there, which consists of squarefor at least a half mile upon the pass, No 33. is a hasty sketch taken offhand in passing a part of this interesting valley, having a large gravel bed in the foreground No 34. is a sketch of curious mountain looking west, from the summet of a gently sloping prairie hill, after having ascended from the narrow passes, and large hills on the east to this much more elevated country. In the afternoon we came upon an extensive open prairie with a gentle slope of miles, without timber and covered with parched grass, so that there was no shade, with an abundance of dust flying in considerable clouds. Several times during the day, Mexicans, richly dressed, and well mounted upon firey steeds, would ride into our ranks, bow politely, talk for a time, and then disappear, we judged them to be the guerrilla spies, and took good care to show them our determination and strength of arms. Just before sunset we arrived at the Hacienda of Tepetate, the proprietor being hostile to the Americans, would not permit us to occupy the Mason, so that we were compelled to camp out not withstanding the night proved to be very cold; we raised our camp fires, and soon prepared excellent though plain suppers, which took their usual round in messes. A strict guard was set, and the1849. March. night passed off without molestation, although anticipated before sunset I took sketch No 35 of Tepetate Hacienda. (Monday)  26th  Day clear and warm. Commenced March this morning at 6. O clock. The scenery ahead was extensive, pretty, and interesting. Several of our men were on the  sick list to day, but nothing very serious, except one man who had his arm broken some days back of San Louis Potosi, but he is now rapidly improving. Our journey today extended 18 leagues, the same as yesterday and one horse lost on this days' march, on every day event with the numerous trains on this route to Gaudalaxara. During the day we passed over a hilly country and  then upon a gently rolling country covered with immense fields of wild cactus, prickly pears, and other thorny plants usually from 5 to 10 feet in height, and often extending thus as far as the eye could reach, without any relief of other plants, &c. I found some pretty specimens of Chalcedony by the way. At evening we arrived at the Hacienda of Novelia, about 100 miles from Potosi. A pretty green valley was spread out on the right, and a similar valley to the left, whilst we descended upon the rocky side of the hill as inNo. 36 into the right hand valley facing the southwest, we camped again in front of a Mason, and they were still hostile towards us. At night a cloud dark as Egypt rol'd o'er us from the North West, with a short but heavy shower, accompanied with heavy thunder and lightning. Our baggage escaped by being carried under shelter, and we passed a very uncomfortable night. About eleven at night when darkness reigned in blackness, a noise like stampeeding or stealing  our horses and mules took place. 7 or 8 of our party immediately proceeded to search for the intruders with loaded arms, but found none there except our mule drivers; An hour after some alarm was created by hearing about 40, reports similar to the firing of guns in quick succession over in the next valley; we were however ready for any guerrillas or other intruders, but they did not trouble us further, as we fired salutes a number of times which echoed along the valley like sober precautions. [*Tuesday 27th*] Day clear and warm. Commenced our march at 6. O. clock, and crossed extensive open, dusty, and hot prarie plains. By eight in the morning the Sun generally gets warm and quite hot by nine, which continues until the customary evening breeze springs up from 12 to 5. O. clock.About noon we passed a romantic village where I sketched the church in No 37. but did not think to learn the name of the village as I was much in the rear when I drew it, besides being attacked by a noisy pack of wolfish dogs. To day we began to find plenty of palatable fruit upon the prickley pear plants that were very abundant on our way; which became more ripened as we advanced. We passed around the base of a lofty and barren rocky mountain into a magnificent valley, where could be seen many handsome Haciendos, ranches little lakes walled up, with strong stone breastwork, extensive fields under good cultivation, some of which were irigated by fresh running streams, woodlands, a small meandering river, orange-groves, and other marks of civilization, besides another long and very beautiful village, along a broad and shady road, very unlike what we had seen since leaving San Louis Potosi. It was really an extensive or far reaching valley of civilization handsome ranches, and a garden spot, among the barren praries and mountains of Central Mexico. Rabbits (with long ears and) of uncommon size, were very plentiful, 7 and 8 have been started at a time, of course we made some fine meals from them; A fine fresh breeze blows yet each afternoon from the Gulf of Mexico but in a few more days we are told that it will blow from the Pacific Ocean, towards the east each afternoon at the same time though opposite to that from the Gulf of Mexico. Before Sun set we landed at a rancho called \"San Nicholas\" a dilapidated rancho unlike much of this fine valley which I sketched as in Number 38. here some of our party were in to bathe, though the water was cold, being considerably elevated; water mellons, eggs, &c. were abundant and cheap, and the mellons of excellent quality. Notwithstanding we might here occupy rooms in a  Mason, yet most of our party preferred sleeping out in the open air, although it was somewhat cool at night. At this place there is a small church, which from the peculiarly rude paintings of Deer &c upon it, I would judge to be very ancient among modern things; it has however a flat roof, which is the customary Mexican fashion of building, except where they have become partially Americanized.Wedned. 28th. Day clear and warm. Commenced our march at 6. O. clock for a short days travel of only 15 miles to the beautiful city of San Maria Del Lagos, which is located down the same handsome and fertile valley as before described. Our road was broad, well setled, and abounded with shade, water, and pretty scenery, whilst we were most of the time in full view of the two opposite mountain ranges of barrenness on each side of this pleasant valley of groves and gardens. We entered Lagos city, over a small but handsome stone bridge, by a broad road, quite equal to some of our American McAdamized roads, and of very pretty and romantic scenery. We entered in double file with the pack mules ahead as usual, and presented quite a line of a military face, as each had his coat off, exhibiting uniformly red flannels, and plenty of well kept arms. Multitudes gazed upon us with apparently great surprise and curiosity, to which we have now become accostomed. After winding about for some time along the various streets, &c, we at last came to quarters in the \"Mason De Merce.\" Crowds soon surrounded our wide spreading archway,to sell us mellons, oranges, sweetmeats, etc. &c. In company  with a friend I visited the Market plaza, where I  purchased a fine cantelope for a Quartelia a 3 ct. piece,  a bowl of buttermilk for a Tolacco, 1 1/2 ct. piece. A good  water mellon for a Quartee, 3 cts. a box of excellent  preserves for a Tolacco, 1 cent and a half, and a good  bowl of coffee for a Madeau or 6 1/4 cts. This is the  only place where I ever saw Ice cream for sale. A number of delicious fruits crowded this market, that  we never see in the States, some of which we found  wild along our road. Near the Market there is a  fine large public plaza, well built up with stones  of the first class, with shade trees, many good seats,  and a handsome fountain in the centre. On the North  side of this plaza there stands one among the most  noble and massive Sanctuaries of Mexico, and usually  ranked among her chief churches, which I  endeavored to sketch as in No. 39. it is build of a hard  light red sand stone approaching a cream color; I did  not obtain its dimensions, but it is certainly larger than  any church which I have ever seen in the States, and  in workmanship equal to the finest church of New York.It rises in Lagos like an immense collosal pile, a great monument of perseverance and skill,. It has been erected about 40 years, and towers above the city like St Peters' at Rome. The interior is still more splendid than its exterior, gorgeous displays of wealth, immense gothic works in gold and  silver leaf, are suspended from the far off ceiling, an organ, richly decorated is supported by a beautiful and curiously formed gallery, Pilasters of great height trimmed with silver leaf, rise between and separate very large and brilliant paintings. Statues, here and there decorated with costly dresses, gems, &c occupy their several positions whilst the chief  Altar is a piece of work of great expense and  magnificense, [whilst] and a high arching dome throws its many color'd lights down upon the rich counter colors of the chief Altar, and gives to the whole a peculiarly beautiful appearance. Bells of great magnitude (originally from Spain) toll at various hours of the day in concert with the other church bells of the city. By permission I ascended the only tower in which the great bells are suspended, andfrom that massive stone cupola, I sketched scene No 40.  looking south west over a portion of that fertile  valley before described, and a part of the city of Lagos,  including several fine churches, and the nunnery &c, showing two important table mountains in the distance, the present bed of the river, which is now nearly dry, and the flat rooves of the city; with a small part of the public plaza. This is the most interesting section for a view out of four, as it comprehends only about 1/4th of the city, and time would not permit me to sketch any others in this interesting city. The delay of a half day at Lagos was occasioned by our horses and mules requiring some improvements in shoeing, thus affording me a short period for sketching. This town includes about 12 thousand inhabitants, and is apparently a thrifty and stirring place of considerable neatness and beauty, though in places antiquated. This afternoon at 2.O.clock, a party of 7 Americans and 5 Frenchmen arrived here from Verra Cruz, and the city of Mexico. They met with troubles and dangers by the way, and were very glad to join in with our company in going to Mazatlan, which a part of them did in dangerous times.[*Thorsd 29th*] Day clear and warm. Commenced our march this morning at 6.O.clock, for the beautiful city of \"San Juan Del Lagos,\" a place of about 7 thousand inhabitants, and about 12 leagues distant from the former. More than half the days march was over a dry and barren country. We approached within a very short distance of the town, before discovering it, as it was  situated in a narrow and very deep valley, and hardly discovered until we had got nearly over it, when we descended a paved road directly into the city of life, and dense crowds of curious spectators. The scenery of this deep and narrow valley, with its meandering  water course, and the distant mountains, was peculiarly  barren and wild; but the town had pleasant orange groves, gardens, &c, with shady walks and fountains here and there and a very handsome plaza, upon which  was the largest and finest Sanctuary we had yet seen even surpassing in magnitude the one last seen,  this was indeed a stupendeous pile of human art and perseverance; a sign informed us that its age exceeded 100, years, and it was yet in an excellent state of preservation. In front of this grand Sanctuary therewas a handsome fountain in the centre of a public plaza, surrounded by seats and in a circle of small Allamo trees. Most of the houses were highly ornamented with various colored devices, whilst rows of massive collonades, made the plaza scene quite agreeable, which was very much crowded by the inhabitants, and the market plaza was in its immediate vicinity. No. 41 is a sketch of the grand Sanctuary of \"San Juan Del Lagos.\" in magnitude and external beauty it exceeds the other at San Maria  Del Lagos, but in its interior magnificense it is about the same though still more expansive. The floor of the interior is inlaid with porcelain of China of various colors of chequered work; and the same upon the outer surface of the great dome. The workmanship of the steeples (which are very high) is considered inferior to none in all Mexico, certainly I never before saw any similar work equal to them, either in Mexico, Canada or the States. Time would scarcely permit a careful sketch of this massive edifice, and night closed upon me without my being able to get others from other positions, of fountains, churches, and a view of the city &c. As our party left early next morning no time of course was available for further sketches.[*Fridy. 30th*] Day clear and warm, Commenced our march at half past six O.clock, crossing a large and costly stone bridge, the handsomest and largest I had yet seen in Mexico; it was handsome and built entirely of a light hard free stone; toll was paid in crossing it. a paved road wound around and up the hill in a serpentine form until it reached the summet, from which there was a splendid view of the town, river, churches, groves, &c; we passed from this pleasant view into another very steep, deep, and narrow valley; from which we arose again to follow a rolling barren country of prarie hills, covered here and there with fragments of loose broken rocks, and much broken chalcedony. An Alcalde with Lady, &c. has accompanied our train for several days, keeping near us, and travelling in a regular Mexican carriage drawn by 6 mules, four of which travel abreast, with a driver sitting upon one of them, the whole affair appeared clumsy. He usually stopped at the same Masons with our company; he was evidently travelling under our  protection from Ladrones or robbers, as the Mail and several Mexican gentlemen were then dooing.about 9.O. clock this morning a body of 3 or 4 hundred Mexican soldiers passed us, followed by many women and children, the whole of whoom were on foot except their officers. At the head of one of their companies was an Irish Deserter who addressed us in the usual language of contempt whilst a number of the soldiers spoke to us in Spanish and a little in the English. They were bound for Rio Verdy, a town of importance towards Tampico, in order to put down Queros and his party, who were opposed to the Government of Herrara. During the after part of this day we passed over an extensive country of open rolling and barren praries, exhibiting scarcely any thing else but rocks, gullies, parched grass and in places an abundance of dust. At evening we landed at an old dilapidated rancho, where provisions were scarce and dear; the name of this rancho was \"Lavent,\" which I sketched and No 42, at sunset. [*Sat. 31st*] Day clear and warm. Commenced our march this morning at half past six O. clock, having only 7 leagues for the day For the first time, we now passed through a valley of gentle undulations, having a very red soil, that  was under cultivation, and appearing to be productive, along the valley there was about a half mile to the right,a high hill appearing very much like an old dilapidated pyramid, which was the opinion of several who saw it. During this mornings march, we passed through several small villages of scattering mud cabins, inhabited as usual by Mexican Indians. About 1.O.clock we descended a paved road into a broad ravine, and after crossing a bridge ascended upon the side of a low spreading hill into the town of Tepatillan, where we remained until the following morning as it was too far to the next rancho for the day. Before night [nigh], I sketched the church as in No. 43. the age of which is nearly a century and a half. It is a plain building, very large, and of an Antiquated appearance. This town contains about 6 thousand inhabitants; having a neat and pleasant appearance about the plaza, and chief streets. The walks of the plaza are all followed by ranges of very large and spreading shade trees resembling the Oak though more expansive. In the centre of this plaza there is a handsome fountain, and on the South Side of it, the town market, and opposite under a long colonade where the Alcalde's office was located. A young man from the States, was arrested [here] by some Frenchmen andimprisoned here on a charge of stealing two hundred  dollars, which he protested against strongly. Most of  our company visited him, and by much taking with  the Alcalde had him taken from a miserable cell  of crowded polution, and placed in better quarters,  we could not get him released, and had to leave him  at the mercy of his enraged enemies, and the Alcalde  believing him to be innocent of that charge, although  he frankly acknowledged having stolen 60 dollars  in Mexico, whilst in distress. Upon which acknowledgement  the Alcalde made out his commitment. The  Frenchmen (we were afterward told.) Said they would  wait until the Americans had left, when by some  means they would get him out, and kill him in the  mountains. The whole appeared like a sad affair. I felt sorry for the young man for we could not  render him assistance without endangering our own  liberty. The feelings of the whole American Company  were against the Frenchmen, who treated him with  severe abuse. He was a delicate young man of about 20.  and said that he had left a widow'd mother and a  sister in the States, and he pointed to a ring on hisfinger, and said that this was the only token of theirs now in his possession, and that at night in his cell, the Mexicans had wrench'd his finger repeatedly to get it. If he escapes, it will be by some miracle unknown to wiley Frenchmen, and stupid Mexicans. This evening the host passed around the plaza drawn in his superb carriage, with the usual ceremonies. April Sund 1st Day clear and warm. Commenced our march at an early hour. The first part of the day we passed over a rolling and barren woodless country, with mountains in the distance. In the afternoon we descended into a lower country a large valley extending many miles and somewhat of a triangular  form as in No 44. In this valley a stream meandered along which in places woodlands appeared. At one place on a low and spreading hill, beside this stream, was located a very romantic and beautiful little town, the admiration of all our company. It appeared to be one forest of very tall orange trees, with bushels beside bushels laying thickly strewn upon the ground in almost every direction with small and neat cabins scattered here and there through these extensive groves. Most of the orange trees  were over 20 feet in height, much resembling largeapple orchards. Among the rest of the pleasant things to be observed here, was a cool and refreshing mountain spring of considerable size rushing rapidly in various branches down the quick descents of several of its streets. Shaded by palms, cactus, orange groves and shrubbery, We passed in sight of the plaza; where I saw a neat looking church. About 4 or 5 miles from this village we passed through another, less shaded, beside the same stream, and near a fair looking stone bridge. Still continuing in this long valley, just before sunset, we came to a river of good size, and descending a long slope lined on either side with Mexican cabins, from a  large mason on the hill, down upon a very large and antiquated stone bridge, upon which were four square towers, upon two of which were statues of the King and Queen of Spain, with an inscription beneath nearly obliterated by time, upon the other two towers were statues of monks or fathers. we crossed this large bridge and put up at a mason on the opposite side in the little town of Tolololotlan, after passing up a street of cabins of more than a mile in length, we found our Mason. I then proceeded in company down to thebeautiful banks of the Rio Grande or San Antonio, and sketched  the great bridge as in No 45, looking north from  above on the west bank of this interesting stream. On the opposite or North side of the bridge of  Tolololotlan, the whole river pitches over large  masses of rocky boulders with a heavy lumbering  roar that can be heard for several miles before  reaching it; above it spreads out to a considerable  width dotted here and there promiscuously with  small and interesting islands, with green meadows  rolling hills, and the lofty blue mountains, all of which  forms a highly picturesque scene, which I endeavored  to sketch as in No 46. On first beholding this fine  little river, it may naturally be supposed that we  rejoiced at the first sight of a stream that emptied  into the great Pacific Ocean, and it seem'd to make  us feel that a part of our great journey to California  via Mexico would soon draw the land chapters  to a grateful close. On the following morning by early light  I sketched a part of the interior of our Mason as in sketch 47.  where the earthen flower jars were plentifully ranged  around the tops of our mason columns, containing  shrubs &c.1849. April. At this place we fell in company with a small New York party  of 8 or 10 persons, and learned from them, that one of  their party had been shot in the head by accident and  killed instantly, it happened at a bridge not far from this  place; the father of the deceased was present in the same company. Mond 2nd Day clear and warm. Commenced our march at 6.O.clock for 8 leagues. Passed through a small cove, and then upon a high plane  where there was a considerable pond or small lake, and  afterwards crossed a deep ravine upon a stone bridge by a  small village, a place noted for robberies &c. and from thence  proceeded over a hilly and picturesque prarie country until  we ascended a considerable ridge, in company with a very  large burthen train of miles for the great city just ahead. On descending this slope into a somewhat lower country  a distant view of Gaudalaxhara, broke upon us as in  sketch 47. which I hastily copied by the way, being then  within about 6 miles of the city and looking North west. Before arriving at Gaudalaxhara, at 4 miles distant, we  passed through a small town of a very pleasant appearance  in which there was the remains of a once superb sanctuary. A handsome shaded plaza with a curious fountain,  and a tall and handsome dragon fountain at the North west  suburbs of the town,on this plaza sweet meats, lemonade, and other  mild drinks with Polka, a drink sweeter than cider, with oranges, mellons, bannannas, and other fruits were very abundant and cheap. the exhibition of which presented quite a pretty appearance as they were promiscuously ranged about the fountain plaza beneath the broad spreading shade trees. From the suburbs of this town to the suburbs of Gaudalaxhora, there is a broad Mc Adamized road 3 miles in length, with 4 rows of spreading shade trees, principally of the Allamo with others of very great magnitude, as in sketch  No 48. extending its whole length, thus dividing two pleasant and shady walks on both sides of the principal road, which was about 50 feet in width, about 100 feet including each walk, this road with its neighboring scenery and a distant inkling of the city presented quite a pretty and interesting appearance. We entered the city in double file, with pack mules in the advance. The suburbs appeared very extensive, and it was at least one hour before we reached our Mason, as we seem'dGaudalaxhara. continually winding hither and thither, among a continuous crowd of strange brown faces and peculiar scenes. Having arrived in one of the handsomest and greatest cities of all Mexico, I hastened to avail myself of every opportunity to explore and discover its fine arts &c. In entering we passed 4 or 5 very handsome public edifices but time would not permit me to sketch them except in a  general view. an aqueduct of water, at first mistaken for a regular canal with stone bridges, abutments and its handsomely finished breast works crosses the southern part of the city proper, along it there are shady walks of trees great Magnitude and age, with fountains in shady places,  and fruit plazas in various directions; watermellons were vastly abundant, and cheap, piles of them were seen on almost every little plaza, where any fruit might be sold. As near as I could ascertain the population of Gaudalaxhara, was about One hundred and seventy five thousand which I believe is about the correct estimate, as it appears much larger than Baltimore, M.D. April. Tuesd 3rd Day warm & clear. Our company concluded to remain in this fine city over this day to proceed early on the morrow. Of course I saw and sketched as much as possible. [*31*]The city is very regularly laid out in right angle streets, usually from 20 to 40 feet in width public gardens and several fine plazas, besides market squares variously. It is considered more than twice as large as San Louis Potosi, and the most beautiful of all the cities of this Republic, and second only to the city of Mexico in size. It is located in an interesting valley, and surrounded by barren mountains in the distance, and elevated several thousand feet above the level of the Ocean. A part of the valley about it is under very good cultivation and presents an extensive and civilized appearance. Every thing combined with a pleasant breezy afternoon, such as we had on entering Gaualaxhara, - a prettier scene could scarcely be found in any of the Northern States of Mexico. It is much admired and spoken of by all travelers who have visited it. Its communications with other towns is conducted entirely by mules, and horses, and all goods carried upon the pack saddles of mules. So that the main roads leading each way from the city, is almost constantly crowded for miles beyond the reach of the eye, with thousands of horsemen, and pack mules, going and returning in large companies.Near this city such scenes are really so animating that it would seem almost incredible were the number at one single view given. Dust is of course very plentiful During this day I visited many parts of the city, the interior of several splendid churches, public buildings, gardens, cemetaries &c. The main plaza, is the most splendid of all that I have yet seen in (all of) Mexico, and said to be handsomer than that of the city of Mexico. It is in the form of a square, followed by Allamo shade trees upon each side, with neat seats, and a handsome fountain in the center. The buildings which surround it are of the first class, and bear much resemblance to all the old Spanish edifices of Spain. The streets which Surround it, for nearly a mile in every direction, exhibit great displays of wealth, fashion, business, and refinement. There is a custom much used here, of covering the pavements with long and massive collonades of one and occasionally two stories in height. Almost every house, building, or edifice, excepting the finest sanctuaries, have the usual flat rooves, and generally a very massive appearance, somewhat similar to Egyptian customs. [*52*]Here strange scenes and strange brown faces, that - densely throng the plazas, markets, groves, [and] fountains, and beneath the long and massive colonnades, makes the American feel at once his absence from home, and his isolated position among the most strange of foreign countries. Strange customs, ceremonies, dress, and modes of living seems to transplanted you at once into another and different world. Go where you will, you are a stranger, and a strange object of gaping curiosity, even to the Soldiers in the Official Pallaces, who would treat you respectfully with small presents of fruits, and politeness, and permit you to intrude on forbidden ground, whilst a common mexican for the same intrusion without a permit, might find a sharp whack upon his callabash the consequence. Among the litterati and official circles of this city there is certainly less hostility to the Americans, than among the illitterate, half Indian, and Servile population, and those on the way back to San Louis Potosi. On the main plaza, there stands an immense Sanctuary of great dimensions and magnificense: It occupies asquare of itself including a grand wing called the Cathedral, as in No. 49. The chief building under the larger dome being called the Sagrario, all of which is now being repaired and repainted with superb interior displays. It is the grand Sanctuary of this city and among its finest buildings for interior displays, which are immensely grand and very elegant; gems, Saints in splendid attire, magnificent Altars, Organs, paintings, large immages apparently cast in gold, over the Altars, inlaid porcelain, work, stained glass of various  colors, beautiful silken draperies, massive silver ornaments, gothic columns, and gothic domes gilt with gold and silver leaf, until the whole glittered by the evening lights like some fabulous golden palace for beings above the common things of mortality. No such scenes of granduer can yet be found in the States, and I have been repeatedly surprised at the enormous wealth, which must have been lavished upon these religious pallaces in Mexico. judging from the time, and immense labor required in their completion; and in their superior pieces of Sculpture, Architecture, and paintings, with their mammoth bells, and [*53*]fine toned Organs, superior castings, elegant designs, drapery, massive granduer, orders of Architecture, and fine materials, which at this day, far exceeds the small and half civilized capacities of the original Mexican inhabitants. From Spain all this display of wealth, &c has originated, been cast, planed, carved, painted, and then transplanted upon the planes, vallies, and mountains of Mexico, and there set up profusely all over the land in immense colosal monuments, whilst Mexico was under that Government. From this beautiful plaza I proceeded towards the aquaduct Southward, where getting upon the flat top of a Mexican Mason or public house, I sketched scene No 50. looking North East, towards some of the mountain ranges, and over the prettiest part of Gaudalaxhara, which I selected from the four views, showing a part of the aquaduct a fine large church, a part of the Hospital in the distance and a fine long park. The principal part of the city rises upon a broad and gentle undulation to the left of this aqueduct, the face of which is dotted here and there with handsomepublic edifices as in this view (No. 50). I then  proceeded to a fine public garden about a mile  from this location, in which I took sketch No. 51. I suppose that it covered about 8 acres, being larger  than any of the squares of Philada. In the centre  of it there was a large fountain, from which fine  walks passed off in each direction. Shade trees  of great magnitude covered the square, whilst the beds were full of beautiful shrubs in full  bloom, which on entering presented to us the appearance of a beautiful shady grove richly and  closely carpeted with many species of flowers  so ingeniously interwoven as to show the  figgure of one large flower by the shades of  those planted together. This I have seen  in many places through Mexico. In this garden  there was a fine large revolving swing with 4 seats,  similar to those in the States. This was a large and  very beautiful garden and appeared to be a place of fashionable  resort. From this place I proceeded towards  the aqueduct and sketched a curious fountain in  the long park as in No. 52. From this fountain [*54*]I proceeded about two miles to the northern suburbs,  and passing several beautiful churches of curious  Architecture, I came to a large enclosed Square, which  proved to be a cemetery; apparently of recent origin.  in the center of this square [was] I sketched No 53.  which is a handsomely ornamented and chequered frame with two interior apportuents which were  beautifully ornamented and richly decorated within  No 54 is a sketch of a beautiful freestone monument in the same enclosure. Directly facing No 53, and at  the opposite end of the same pavement I sketched  the grand collonade building as in No 55. each of those  square chambers along it are intended for two or more  coffins, the door of which being closed has upon the outer side the usual inscription of the tombstone. Day light prevented further sketches , though I would have taken many more if the opportunities would have  permitted. The market plazas were located in  several parts of the city, and were crowded to  excess with watermelons and other fruits. and on  one plaza exceeding any thing I had ever seen in  Mexico, and a most beautiful sight too, as everythingwas very tastefully arranged, even to the different colors of Lemonades, &c. Many fruits were abundant here that are never seen in the States.  most of which are sold at reasonable prices. After leaving the cold winter of the States and comming so suddenly into hot weather, dust, mellons, and oceans of fruit amid a Summer heat in Mexico  you may well suppose that we are quite sensible of this change; whilst we often remarked to each other, that our relatives at home little thought that we were now feasting upon the  finest mellons in the world, whilst the cold winds of winter were whistling around their homes. I doo not think that there are more churches here than in San Louis Potosi, notwithstanding this is so much longer than the former city of Potosi. I visited several fine churches, but had no  time to sketch even a small part of the great beauties I saw during even this one day. Though vehicles of any kind were seldom seen through  the country, yet heavy carriages of a clumsey - [*55*]   appearance for the aristocracy and the Priests were quite plentifull in townThe americans still continue to arrive in this city, 40 more during this day from Mexico. Wed 4th. Day clear and warm. Commenced our march at 6.O. clock. On leaving the city, we passed the walls of an extensive prison, which was being erected of stone, at the North Western suburbs. The road was broad, very much crowded, and almost one continued cloud of dust for many miles out of the city. About four miles on the way we passed a neat little village, with a magnificent Sanctuary or public edifice, therein of enormous dimensions and square walls enclosing some 8 or 10 acres, with very high (18 or 20 feet) iron railing in front which was ornamented and gilt, and ranging a full square between delicate pillars and light arches of stone. Some of our party supposed that it was the Bishop's Palace. About 12 miles from the city we passed a tall gate; it was a high stone gate crossing the road in one arch about 35 feet in height with a large Mason, and a few scattering huts about it. After this our road wound aroud large hills, deep ravines, through several narrow passes, and for the first time in a great distance, among numerous large pines, oak bushes, &c ranging over desolate looking hills.At about 20 miles from Gaudalaxhara, I made a hasty sketch  looking west as in No 56. showing the mountains and a small part of the lower valley country, which is somewhat below  the valley of the city we have just left. This is a celebrated  part of the country for Robberies, and we were even told in Gaudlaxhara, that two hundred, Ladrones or  Robbers had left that city the night before us, on our way  to cut us off at about 30 miles out. We did not however regard it, knowing the veracity of Mexican reports  which generally had some other crafty object in view. At about 22. or 23 miles from the city, we came upon an open prarie of rolling or undulating knolls, a part of which had them been recently burned off, on this black charry and dismal looking place, there stood  a large and high gallows, upon which were suspended  the bodies of three Robber chiefs; they had been suspended  there about 3 weeks, and were ghastly looking objects, bullet holes preforated their dried bodies in many  places which were nearly ready to drop to the earth.  over them was a large painted Sign, as follows -  \"Thus the Law punishes the Robber and the Assassin\". Only a few weeks before we arrived here these men [*56*]were chief actors in some bloody deeds, about this place, until some of the government troops overtook them with the justice they merited. The number of these Robbers are said to have been about 200 strong, committing  constant depridations and murders upon travellers and many of the regular Mexican baggage trains. This scene was to melancholy a picture to sketch, so that I left it for a more fit object and about 3. miles further west, as in sketch No 57. I copied a peculiar mountain and small village, to the right of which our road continued its torturous course. In the afternoon as we descended into a third interesting valley, our mountain scenery became extensive, very lofty, and peculiarly wild, moreso than we had yet seen them. Upon the right and upon the left were seen towering mountains, with immense barren cliffs above cliffs, and their numerous rugged woodless spears rising high in the air like collosal ruins of pyramids of yet untold of magnitude. To the west this great triangular valley tapered to our interesting focus, at the far point of which the sun was setting amid a few light and beautiful clouds.whilst the mountains diminished gradually as they receded in the background, all of which formed quite an intersting and beautiful landscape view though very wild. We then descended a hill into the lower valley, and took quarters for the night in a mason, beside the church on the market plaza of the town of Amattitan, being about 40 miles from Gaudalaxhara. Before dark I ascended a high precipice of rocks east of the market plaza, and sketched No 58. showing the square, the big walled spring facing the market, part of the church, part of the town of Amattitan, with its shade trees, with a part of the valley, and the mountains on the western horizon. Here we found plenty of mellons and other fruits all which were quite cheap. Our company here numbered over fifty. A part of them sat by moonlight under the broad archway of the gate of our mason, until 9. O. clock singing in concert, the national songs of America, some 60 or 70 Mexicans, crowded around them seemingly much delighted. About 9.O. clock a Mexican having stolen a purse, from Mr Hassan, was persued and shot at by him, which scattered the rest in short metre.The Alcalde, called next morning and commeded Mr Hassans' course, by saying that he wished Mr H. had killed the thief; it appears that he was wounded, but got off with the bead purse. We were informed at Gaudalaxhara, that this town was, and had been a celebrated rendezvous for the mountain Robbers. &c. [*Thurs'd. 5th*] Day warm and clear. Left Amattitan by early sun rise, and continued our march North west across the valley, among rolling hills of gentle slopes, having small rancho's here and there at short periods; this days road was peculiarly interesting in its scenery we saw to day many fields of the maguay plant ranging over many gentle hills, and upon some of the few fertile spots along the wild mountains base. They make a mild drink from it called  Polka, also the Ardiente, which is stronger than  whiskey, which I believe is made from the magauy also. About 11.O. clock A.M. we passed through Tekelah a town of some importance, noting perhaps 4000 inhabitants. It had a fine shady plaza, upon which stood a very large and antiquated church. On the plaza, fruit appeared in great abundance, andgoing through their usual ceremonies. fruits were abundant and 18, oranges were  bought here for a Madeau or 6 1/4 cts. Orange groves compose the  chief shade of the town. Several very large springs or rather small creeks, breakout of the hills east of the town square, and meander in rapid streams through several of the streets. The water was of a slightly milky cast, and an unpalatable limestone taste. At night the moon rose full and clear, with an occasional flitting cloud, and a gentle breeze. This night a band of 40 Mexicans, all [each] well armed with muskets, pistols, swords, and knives; - presented themselves in double file at the gate of our Mason, or Hotel; and demanded quarters there for the night. Our landlord believing them to be robbers told us to prepare our arms for service, which we did in a few minutes. The Landlord then told them through their captain, that his apartments were all full, and that they could not have quarters in his Mason, to which their captain answered that they would come in in defiance of him and those within. The gate of the Mason which was very broad, and of one expansive arch; the doors of which being open, the Robbers drew themselves up in a compact body immediately before it on the pavement and street. Our landlord stepping forward told them that they must wait a short time until he could see further about his accomodations. But he immediately passed out by another way from his Mason, in pursuit of the Alcalde of the town, who in a short time came with him to our quarters. The Alcalde enquired of their captain who they were, where from be. They answered that they were government soldiers; He then demanded of their captain, their passport as government soldiers, - but they could show none besides the said company acknowledged having travelled on two days, which by the laws of Mexico, no government troops, are permitted to travel. By their dress superabundance of arms, and statements the Alcalde judged them to be a band of ladrones or Robbers, following us, and not improbable that they were a detachment of a larger body, sent in town as government troops, in order to stop overnight in the walls of our Hotel to take us by surpriseand most probably after stealing our arms, then to attack the town, which is a common occurrence in many parts of Mexico. The Alcalde told us that he believed them to be Robbers. He evidently feared them. He told us to see that our arms were all in order and ready for execution in case we were attacked. Its a matter of course all our men were prompt in self defence, and with our guns, pistols, and knives, in hand and about us, we drew up in order, compactly before the door, facing the Robbers, who stood quietly facing and viewing us as mute as a posse of terrified owls; the Alcalde and our landlord refused them admittance into our Mason, but they would have entered by force had not our company presented a bolder front, headed by Capt Grant, of Philadelphia; who told them that they should not enter, except at the peril of their lives, at the same time every trigger was ready to tell. A moment of suspense, and they decamped in quick step up to the town plaxa, where they were permitted to stay by the authorities. After this the Alcalde came several times to ourquarters, telling us to put on extra guards, which we did, even upon the high walls, in order to stand sentinel over our horses as well as our other property, and persons. The Alcalde told us that there was a probability of either our company or the town being attack'd during the night, and wished us to promise that in case the town was attack'd by them, to assist the citizens and his little military force in putting down the Robbers, which we promised, and on the other hand he told us that if the attack should be directed first towards us, his people should assist us, but that we must not mistake and fire upon a religious procession of the citizens which would pass our Mason about 3 O. clock in the morning. This was an evening long to be remembered from many circumstances. It was a most beautiful moonlight night, and now and then a gentle breeze played fitfully from the beautiful lake of Madalena; My turn among the sentinels came from 12 to 2 O clock in the morning; and my positions around the high walls, and the expansive enclosed yards, was pleasant and romantic during so pleasant a night as this; seeming at times like a dream, that I were facing therounds of some ancient castle and looking down among the  dark shades of the groves around slumbering in silence beneath the full and magic moon. I stood upon the house top, meditating upon the beautiful Lake of Madalena, the mountains, standing off in deep shadows, the many flat rooves, the groves and the rocky cliffs near the town; about 2. O. clock a procession of the citizens took place; proceeding from the church and passed our Mason. It was headed by richly robed priests, who were chanting solemn airs; a full sized wax figure of our Savior, of full size, clothed in mourning with a crown of thorns, representing Him as passing up to Mount Calvary, whilst before Him were carried several hundred candles, with several hundred Mexican ladies following each with candles, accompanied with an excellent band of music, the whole was a peculiar scene. Before day light those Ladrones or Robbers before named had all disappeared, having preceeded us on our road through a formidable mountain and vastly grand ravine country, of deep cavernous valleys, suiting such a class of beings.1849 April 6th bay warm and clear. Commenced our march at  half past six o clock, winding our way around that beautiful and interesting lake of Madalena. Formidable mountains appeared in full view and an immense country of sugar loaf hills, sharp peaks, several hundred of which might be seen at one view from elevated positions, at times we passed over a graded road, upon which considerable pains had been taken, about 10 A.M. we descended into a very deep and curious valley of about two miles in width, passing down which it spread out to higher rolling hills with very deep chasms for water passing around these hills and amongst them variously. About 12  meridian I sketched Scene No 63 which was a large Hacienda, westward appeared very large mountains, between which and the Hacienda one several tortuous ravines, the deepest and most awfully grand that I ever saw, being more like immense caverns than ravines. through which we passed about 15 miles. They are called the \"Baranca's\". a road descends upon the  almost perpendicular face of one of them, which is very tortuous and romantic; as you might see the train quite beneath us.winding their way far down the deep cavernous  valley of the Baranca's; as in No 64. with high and  barren Mountains, sparcely timbered towering far above  these numerous deep Barancas. Passing along these  deep narrow vallies, we crossed several times a rapid  creek of some magnitude, over which in many places  high brown rocky cliffs, and various timbers,  bend gracefully over its romatic and noisy waters. No 65. is a sketch passing down the creek in this valley. No 66. do a short distance north west of the former sketch,   with high frowning bluffs of brown rocks. No 67. is another  passing father down the stream, where the road ascends  and again descends to the creek; after fording which  upon rocks [upon] from which the water was bounding  away rapidly; we ascended upon the opposite side,  where a small race of water descended to a pleasant  little dwelling, about which fine timber, several  species of very high cactus, and underbrush with luxuriant  grass were seen forming a highly picturesque  and romantic view. But our train passed so rapidly  that I was much in the rear with my last sketches,  and had to omit this pretty scene for one whichfollowed shortly after as in sketch no 68 where we came to  the junction of apparently three triangular vallies, or deep passes of the Barancas, and the junction of the two fine streams of fair water. At this place there was a pleasant Rancho over the creek, with little groves of oaks, pines, cactus, Bannannas, and beautiful green meadows. Our train turned round and up the left hand valley. And presently  came to scene as in No 69, very high, barren, and steep mountains of almost no timber, arose high in the air, with slight misty clouds around their summets; upon the side of one of them a road was seen ascending which is a view of a part of a graded road, cut over this great mountain by some foreigners at an immense cost, and in most places blown through the solid rock, and of excellent workmanship. In this little valley there was a mill of some kind in operation with a large horizontal wheel. I was afterwards told for the purpose of washing out the silver ore beneath the road, seen on the mountainside, there is a small and pleasant village, in which there is an abundance of fine fruits and surrounded by extensive green fields, meadows, groves, and fine timbers along the stream that meanders through its valley, that spreads  out to a ---triangular cove, dotted with several pleasant Rancho's, No 70. is a sketch taken on entering this pleasant cove where the village was located. After leaving the village we commenced ascending the mountain road. Time would not permit me to sketch as much as I desired, No 71. shows the workmanship on our fine road over, one of the most formidable mountains in Mexico, it is cut out of the rocks, and walled paved and graded thus all the way up this mountain for a distance of six miles. and as great a piece of work of its kind, as any that I know of in the U States of America. No 72. is another sketch farther up this fine road. The view from the Summet of this mountain looking eastward was fine indeed; including many a green and beautiful valley and more mountains, peaks, knolls, hills, vallies, dales, coves, and verdant spots, blended with wildness and prarie hills, than I had ever yet seen in all Mexico; and was really grand beyond description. The mountains far east about Gaudalaxhara could be seen like smoky shadows of deep blue mist. It is said that we have ascended to day, more than  7000 feet, above the deep Barancas through whichwe have just passed; and still a peak arises to our right, around which we wound our tortuous way looking over walls, that looked straight down upon abyss's that were quite beneath us thousands of feet. I found enough here for days of sketching, over which we passed rapidly as it was a region said to be well filled with Robbers, and frequent to many scenes of bloodshed, robbery, and other vile deeds; a few desperate men in these wild mountain passes could doo much harm even to a  large party. On the summit there is a rude breastwork evidently thrown up for that purpose. Cliffs of huge brown rocks here hang over frightful debths and thousands of deep ravines cut deep into and down the rugged mountain. This is our highest elevation  in crossing Mexico, we have gradually ascended 7000 feet to the Barancas, and about 7000 feet again to the summet of this grand dividing ridge of Mexico, making in all an elevation of about 14000 feet above the levil of the Sea. Upon this height we now have the afternoon winds from the Pacific Ocean; and from this forward to the Pacific each day, blowing uniformly from the west, and sometimes very strongly.We now commence our gradual descent toward the Pacific Ocean, an event of some interest to us of course; leaving the scenes east of the great Cordilleres, for those descending gradually into the mild and fertile vallies on the  great western side of this distinguished mountain. No 73. is a sketch of the first scene descending into  a beautiful and fertile valley, along which are plenty of Ranchos, several small villages, several sugar  mills, fine farms, meadows, groves, and plenty of small Mexican dwellings, shaded by Bannanas, Plantains, or perhaps the Allamo, or at times the spreading oak. A pleasant stream of water meandered along this  valley, the margin of which was thickly interwoven with brushwood, wildflowers, and followed by pleasant green meadows, which contrasted in a striking manner with the shadeless, and wild barren mountains; that were broken and rudely tossed into the high air as the fierce storms would toss the waters of the mighty ocean; and as rudely wild, and void of vegetation or timber in many places. This day we have made a march of 54 miles, and arrived at our Mason in the town of [Eastlan ?] a hour after sun set. It appeared to be a fine largetown; at sun set I sketched Eastlan at a distance of a few miles to the  east, being in advance of a part of our train, which during this day got much scattered on the way. There was a fine large Church in this town, with a large shaded plaza or public square, upon which there was a grand display of many  kinds of fruits, drinks &c. including watermellons, Oranges, Bannanas, &c. &c. with Lemonade; Polka, etc. A grand procession of the virgin Mary took place, this evening parading in large crowds the various streets of the town with hundreds of Ladies and Gentlemen each in procession, carrying their separate candles. The immage of the Virgin, was of full size, richly dressed in dark silks, and carried in a handsome Sedan; Other processions took place during  the evening; but I did not see all of them. This is a beautiful town of several thousand inhabitants; the houses are improving, are much neater, larger, and the people becoming much more refined and civilized than many of those before passed; Western Mexico, is well known to be the most refined and civilized portion of that country. We were much pleased with the decided improvement of whitewashing and other displays of taste in this place.No 74. is a hasty sketch of Eastlan and its surrounding mountains. The valley in which it is situated, descends gradually westward towards the Pacific Ocean; and is under good cultivation with pleasant Ranchos', several small villages &c. [*April 7th*] Day warm and clear; with an afternoon breeze from the  Pacific. Commenced our march at sun rise; and proceeded along the meanderings of a pleasant creek; that traversed this interesting valley. A few miles west of Eastlan we passed through a town of considerable size, within which there was a handsome shaded plaza, with a large, curious, and antiquated church. This town was also much shaded by Bannana and Orange groves and a greater part of the houses were very genteel. Here some of our company obtained excellent cups of chocolate &c. Many kinds of fruit were likewise abundant in this place. By the way, as we have before frequently seen, were erected several small shrines of some 8 or 10 feet square, in each of which was suspended the  cross, and around which were wreaths of roses, natural and artificial, with candles partly burned, and other things belonging to their religious ceremonies. These with lone cross's are to be seen plentifully throughoutMexico, and either mark a place of worship, or the spot where some individual has [been] met with an untimely  end. Proceeding down this pleasant valley and winding around various spurs of the wild mountains, that  rear'd their rugged heads upon either side of us, we at 15 miles from Eastlan opened upon a view as in No. 75, with the appearance of a volcano to the right hand. The creek that before travelled rapidly a rocky bed, now joined with other water courses in passing through a ravine or narrow channel of great debth. We now passed over immense fields of wildest volcanic rocks that at some period had been partly fused, and thrown up in rugged masses exceeding any description; extending thus for many miles west and North. The appearance of the rocks was quite black; in places quite spongy, and resembling somewhat the heavy spray of a wild Ocean storm, thrown up in massive peaks, and pinacles, that were at  once suddenly petrified or cooled into black rocky masses of half fused granite &c. Such a field of forrest peaks and black [Schorae ?], I have never before witnessed. The government of Mexico, have cut and paved a road through this lava country at great expense, labor and time.The particulars of which they have taken care to place  upon a pedestial by the way side; whereas by passing the road (such as it was) around a few miles to the left  they might have avoided the worst peaks and ridges  of the [Schorae ?]. Some scrubb oaks high pentangular cactus,  Etc shaded the Lava road in places, until we came out upon  barren hills. No 76 shows a hasty sketch of a part of the  lava fields on our way, looking back Southeast. About  this valley, which have spread out to many miles,  many little Ranchos and villages were to be seen upon  the fertile spots, like favored places upon the  desert of Arabia. The mountains around were exceedingly  wild, and only a few of them even sparsely timbered by a  dwarfish growth, of scrubb oaks, pines, and wild cactus. This broad triangular cove or great valley, was traversed  in every direction by hills, between which were small and  fertile coves, passes, and ravines, along which only the villages  and Ranchos were located. During this afternoon we passed through several pretty villages, that were snugly hid  away in these little vallies, and after passing over   a number of rolling hills, we ascended a mountain  to the north, where we encamped at Rancho Ocott.a few hundred yards from this rancho I sketched scene No 77. looking back Southward upon that great valley of vallies, over which we had just passed; from a height of about two thousand feet. I then passed on up the road 2 miles with a friend, and from a height looking into a vast ravine of perhaps 8 or 10 hundred feet, I sketched scene No 78. looking South west. Showing two great mountains rising in a part of the valley before named; a large stream of water was leaping and bounding off from cliff to cliff down this immense ravine, the sound of which could be heard a considerable distance; whilst it was closely shaded by tall timbers, that rose up the steep sides of the abyss, near to its summet edge. During this day we have seen back in the valley several fine falls of water from 5 to 60 or 70 feet, very suitable for mills but not improved. Along this deep ravine there are fine locations for such purposes. From this place Northward the timber for many miles became very large and plentiful; with large Oaks and pines in particular. During this afternoon Mr Slaight and Mr Jones two of our company were misled upon the wrong track, which caused some fears as to their safety, but both came into camp just  before dark.It is highly important that companies should keep compact whilst crossing the Mountains of Mexico, as those who stray off, are liable to be cut off by those who constantly watch such opportunities in the  trail of the large parties who may cross their country  April 8th  Day warm and clear. During this night individuals well known, left our camp by night, and proceeded forward at full speed, 16 leagues to Tepec, in advance of our train, in order to Secure passage up to california for themselves exclusive of our company should there not be room for all. This was showing their nature horns and all, for which they afterwards doubtless sorely repented, as certain of them had before promised to remain by each other through to California. The remainder of our company proceeded as usual not at all pleased with the rush for passage, almost every Mexican  returning; when asked, gave us different reports about the chances of passenger from San Blass up to San Francisco; and we could ascertain nothing very definite and but little that was encouraging. Some telling us that there was but one vessel in port which could take but four or five more passengers and prices very high, with poor accommodations; others,that there were several vessels in port, and others that there were none that could carry more passengers, and thus the reports varied, but the remainder of us thought best to take things coolly and as they might come; which afterwards proved to be to our especial advantage at Mazatlan. Proceeding northward on the Summet of the mountain on  which we had just encamped, we passed through much large and valuable oak timber. During the morning, I  sketched No 79. which includes Norelio Mountain, as seen  at the distance of about 10 miles to the northward, being also within full view of the town of Tepec to which we were bound. About an hour after sketching the former, we commenced descending a graded road down the mountain,  a part of which I sketched as in No 80. after which we  crossed a fine creek, then passed over and around a number of wild hills with but few scattering habitations, and those of the poorest kind until we came out upon the open woodless hills, that were beautifully rounded and moulded as by art, and only covered by parched prairie grass, and  ranging thus at random around the base of the great Novelio Mountain, whilst sloping off gently in an extensive valley, which was walled in on the North, East, and South by formidable mountains.Again, we ascended a small ridge, which soon gave us a fine view of the great valley of Tepec. We continued descending for Some time upon rolling hills, very sparcely timber with here and there patches of Scrubb oaks, cactus, etc. within about 6 miles of Tepec. I took sketch No. 81. [showing] showing the appearance of the country around that beautiful town. And before entering the town within about a mile and a half I took sketch No 82. showing a fine Stonebridge plastered, and of neat construction; on the principal road to Tepec. This road is generally broad, though not agreeable for [?] vehicles of any kind and is likewise well supplied with fine dust, which during (this) the dry season is almost intolerable during a windy afternoon. Our company arrived in Tepec at 3.O. clock. P.M. a band of dusty travellers, with long beards, jaded, and all the usual et ceteras that attend such a long journey and more especially in Mexico, but not yet closing our journey through this peculiar country. On arriving we ascertained that those preceding us to Tepec had engaged passage up to San Francisco upon a schooner of about 30 tons, that was said to be unfit for service. They paying 70 dollars, and find themselvesbesides being compelled to sleep upon deck; and even at that thinking themselves lucky in getting the chance, at the same time chuckling at us, whoom they considered unfortunate; in not having a chance to sail from San Blass, and at the same time telling us that they pittied us, as we must evidently remain somewheres in Mexico possibly for months to come. But believing that from the greater importance of Mazatlan as a sea port, and place of business, we concluded after resting a day in Tepec to proceed thither, although it was yet another week's journey, the result of which will be seen greatly to our advantage. April 9th  Day warm and clear. In company with a friend (Mr. Sayre), I proceeded this morning at an early hour, several miles out of town upon the summet of a neighboring mountain; (it being a day rest for our animals &c) from the heights of which, an extensive and most beautiful view opened in every direction To the east we saw the lofty peaks of Novelio mountain, and very many of those pretty woodless, and grass covered egg shaped hills before mentioned. Far beyond which formidable mountains reared their misty shadows in dim outline high upon the horizon, upon which the morning's sun had already arissen in his glory amid flitting clouds. The South, thesome great chain of mountains ranged with their many lofty peaks; South west a beautiful valley continued for miles,  with a high mountain ranging west of it. The same mountain  approaching to within a mile of our peak, fell off abruptly  and a valley turned around at right angles with the  former, ranging off into red hills, towards the Pacific Ocean. An extensive and magnificent view broke upon us from  the North, which I endeavored to sketch as in No. 83. North East were seen mountains and peaks piled upon  mountains, many of which were seen far above the mists  and detached clouds of the morning. Here the country  descends rapidly upon the Pacific plains, which are  nearly two days journey from Tepec. The plains could  be seen far on the dim horizon but not the Ocean. This scene was extensive and grand beyond description. To the north and several hundred feet below us, there was  a circular lake of water, No. 84. partly covered with  green rushes, and edged by high walls of rocks, being rugged  bluffs of dark brown rocks, in places covered with a red soil. This lake was nearly round, and elevated several  hundred feet above the valley of Tepec, and exhibited  all the signs of having been at some period a vastcrater to this volcanic country, but now filled up  with water. We then descended into a deep ravine, at the  foot of the hill (letter A) No 84. Through which a fine large stream  water descended rapidly upon a rocky bed. Near the foot  of hill A. is located an extensive cotton factory belonging to Mess  Forbes & Co. as in sketch No 85 .and sketch No 86. taking  two different views of this handsome establishment. The proprietors I believe are Englishmen. Their garden  of Bannanas, Plantains, Oranges and other tropical fruits, is extensive, and exceedingly beautiful, and  more to the idea of some Hindoo scene than one in Mexico. The whole scenery about this factory is  pretty, tasty and romantic. This establishment does  an extensive business. We returned to town by 2.O. clock P.M. after which I sketched the interior of our  Mason (No 87.) or public house, which was tastefull constructed;  our quarters however were not as agreeable as the  appearance of the place. The church on the plaza was large  but of an ordinary appearance, and another similar one  in the town, but a very handsome one of smaller dimensions  1 1/2 miles from the plaza, which time would not  permit me to sketch, and attend to other duties.A hasty sketch of the plaza was also taken as in No 88. It was surrounded by large shade trees of the oak; and in the centre of it there was a pretty fountain of a plain but neat appearance. The plaza was almost entirely surrounded by colonade rows of usually two Story Stores of the first class. The streets of the town ran uniformly at right angles; were clean, and well paved; the same at Gaudalaxhara, the towns of Logos, and San Louis Potosi, etc. The rooves of the houses were uniformly flat, generally one story in height, frequently whitewashed, or neatly ornamented with various colors. But the suburbs of the town, as usual for Mexico, was surrounded by small mud cabins which so much destroys the good effects of Scenery about the Mexican towns, villages, Rancho's etc. At Tepec, we met another American party, and here also 10 of our company left us in order to proceed a distance of 60 miles to San Blass, and from thence embark upon a vessel they had never seen, which afterwards proved to be unseaworthy and landed them some 9 or 10 days afterwards at Mazatlan in (distress and other) difficultiesWe had remonstrated with them however at Tepec, and there they considered their chances much superior to ours. [*April 10th*]  Day warm and clear. Left Tepec at an early hour, and proceeded through a northwest pass, among red hills, little coves, and small narrow and fertile vallies among Shady groves, palms, Bannanas, Plantains, Oranges, &c. and when plenty of watermellons could be  obtained very cheap with other fruits, this region of the country appeared well setled with neat and Shady Ranches, and well supplied with running streams of water. Many farms here appeared like little paradis's for shade romance, and the comforts of life; and many were the  varied scenes of this [day] morning that were really captivating. [except] But in the after part of the day upon the planes, having descended upon a warmer country, we were  open more to the sun, and much annoyed by dust. In making our grand descent upon the plains, we passed down over a long rotine of rugged hills, that gradually diminished as we descended, being sparcely covered with large Palm trees, some underbrush, and now and then parched, prarie grass not of much interest. The view however on descending was extensive, as in sketch No 89.Having descended upon the Pacific Plains, we were  again in a much warmer climate. We again passed from the dull monotony of timbers upon the mountains when such may be found, to a lower country where a large variety were daily presented to our notice. We now saw Palms in great abundance, large oaks, the Banyan, Beach, some cedar, large cotton bearing trees, tropical fruit trees plentifully, with many whose species were unknown to us. We passed several small villages on the planes, and a number of Ranchos. Enormous trees of a species with which I am not familiar, but resembling the mulberry somewhat in shape  and leaf, and in other respects the Beach tree, grows by the road side in many places, and being dense for spreading and of very great magnitude, it frequently gave us an acceptable shade; during our travels across the planes. These five large shade trees, are however not too abundant, and by seeing them in the distance I frequently judged our distance from a Rancho; as they are favorite trees on these planes. This afternoon we crossed two almost dry beds of wheat when flush were called rivers, but not of great magnitudeOn this days route fruits, Mellons, etc, were plentiful and cheap. 16 Bannanas for 6 1/4 cts or a Madeau, A fair water mellon for a Madeau (6 1/4 cts) 1 madeau for a dish of beans stew'd with some meat. 1 madeau for 3 boiled eggs, and 1 madeau for 4 or 6 tortelias or corn cakes; As we had found it on the other side of the Cordilleres, we also experienced here; high prices in Scarce and barren places, and cheap things where the soil was good, well settled, and fruit groves, etc, consequently to be found. About 3 O. clock P.M. our train halted for the night at a Rancho 33 miles N west of Tepec which I sketched as in No 90. The water of a neighboring creek being warm, a part of our company were in to bathe. During this night Mr Davis (who joined us some days back) was scalded by the accidental overturning of our large camp kettle, in which was stewing a fine mess of chicken, supposed to have been done by wolves, that were heard about just before I was on duty as one of the Sentinels from 12 to 2 and several times, heard the wolves, Mr D was not badly scalded however. [*April 11th*]  Day clear and hot. Commenced our march at an early hour, and soon forded a broad and very rocky creek, and during the morning passed through several acceptable woodland groves.Passed a number of ranchos where fruits &c. were plenty and cheap; and the country now generally quite levil. About noon, we came upon the broad sandy beach of a river. Our saddles, baggage, &c. was conveyed across in small boats, (canoes) whilst the whole drove of our animals swam the river together. The scene was  interesting and having a few moments (after just finishing a fine large water mellon) I sat down and  sketched the river, Mountains, &c., as in View No 91. The mountains were still in view; and follow upon our right, all the way to Mazatlan, as we are now persuing our way up the coast, though not yet in Sight of the Pacific Ocean. This river which we have just now crossed (I was told) is called the \"Rio San Diago\", being about 18 Mexican leagues from Tepec, or something over 50 miles. Having crossed the River, whilst the mules was reloading &c. for our further progress, most of our company went into a town nearby (of some size) and refreshed themselves upon fruits, coffee, chocolate, eggs, &c. etc. The town though of good size, was dilapidated and of an ordinary appearance, though commanding apretty location. Persuing our course over a very dusty road that wound hither and thither upon a levil country of brushwood and larger clusters of timber, we passed through a village of perhaps 40 or more houses, all entirely deserted, except one, which was tennanted by one Solitary man of a fierce countenance, being a cripple, who had only a few poor mellons for sale at high rates. This was rather strange yet strangely true, one man the Sole lord of a desolate village, no other Mexican was seen in the whole place, and all was closed up without Signs of furniture; the place may have fell into the hands of Robbers, or be unhealthy; we did not ask respecting it of the man, although it excited remarks in our company. This afternoon afforded but little of interest except some large cotton fields, with ripe cotton, belonging to some Ranchos, and surrounded by fences, which is an uncommon thing in this country, fences are very  rare throughout all Mexico. we travelled many hundred miles without even seeing a fence; although there may be many farms, it is not every man that has a fence, and even those who posess them mostly have very short appologies for fences, which  are rare things in Mexico,I mean fences of wood stone fences of great length, have been seen almost every day or two, amongst the settled parts of the mountains. To day we saw, as beforementioned, fine fields of cotton; but for the first time that I remember in Mexico. We also saw a wild tree about the size and shape of an ordinary apple tree, bearing large and numerous pods of the fine white cotton; And a number of curious fruit trees about the woodlands and water courses. Much of this days travels, all things considered is not by any means inviting to travellers; being dusty in places open to the hot sun, and much of the time rather uncivilized in appearance, which however is no criterion to judge western Mexico by. Before sunset we halted, after a long days march at the Rancho of \"Buena Vista\" being about 145 miles from Mazatlan. I sketched this place as in No 92. A friend Mr Custer, and I went out afar the creak near by for game, and we returned in about 15 minutes with 3 large Pheasants upon which we made a fine supper, and obtained plenty more for our breakfast, and to carry with us for our dinner, our company numbering at this time between 25 and 30. Since leaving Tepec, those for San Blass taking  another road.[*April Thorsd 12th*] Left our Rancho at an early hour. Day clear and hot; with the usual afternoon winds from the Pacific. Passed over an extensive palm country this day, gentle slopes all day covered sparcely with tall and scattered Palm trees, grass burnt off for miles in places; much wild game by the way, few habitations, and those generally of the lowest class. In the morning sketched No 93. of the lofty peaks &c. of the  Cordilleres on our night, which are always in full view in passing up the coast . About noon we again came  to the bank of another River which was partly dry, and at this season fordable, I did not ask its name, but the town of Cauponetta , was on the opposite side to which we forded. A number of Mexican women were along the margin of this river at their customary employment of  washing out clothing; one very clear trait of the Mexicans. Sketch No 94. shows, the river, town, and mountain scenery from opposite Cauponette Puebla. After refreshing  ourselves upon mellons, fruit, etc, in this pleasant town we proceeded forward at a rapid gait to finish a long days march. Much of our road was very dusty, though there was less wind than usual; our country slightly rolling and upon the night a full view of the lofty mountains of the coast.This night we encamped at a desolate Rancho a few miles beyond a river, where things had a distressing appearance we could neither obtain water or food of any importance at this place, so that most of us had neither supper nor breakfast. The appearance of everything about these few huts, was perfectly squallid, and the natives almost totally unclothed and appearing reckless and unconcerned about any thing. We camped beside the road, and huts, and kept strict watch during the night; but a few miles back, on the other side of the river we could have encamped at a small village, where all the conveniences were at hand, but being only a few days from Mazatlan, our company became very anxious to finish their land travels in Mexico, and consequently pressed each day. We missed it, decidedly in crossing the river this night, as we left a pleasant camp grove and conveniences at that place, for a desolate place where we lost two meals, and had no water either for our animals or ourselves  April 13th  Day warm and clear with a fine seabreeze this afternoon Passed through a nearly level country, covered with scattering palms; we came to a village of a squallid appearance about 10. O.clock A.M. where by much trouble we made out to get something to  eat.of all squallid places we had yet seen, this village was the climax. Here in front of a cabin, sat a wretched looking woman clothed in rags, and her feet projecting on the walk from a heavy pair of wooden stocks, where she was fastened probably for some offence. The whole of the inhabitants were almost entirely unclothed and appeared to be living in misery and starvation. Having the bold mountains on our right which were all day in full view, we proceeded onward up the coast through Palm forrests, that seem'd never ending, and towards noon oppressively hot; several crosses were passed this day; whilst this section of the country appeared very much uncivilized; and we frequently met men, entirely without clothing. A range of mountains seem'd now to range off west to the Pacific Ocean, over which it appeared that we must pass, on the morrow; approaching within a few miles of their wild and rugged base, we encamped at a Rancho called Cerauso, as in Sketch No 95. here things appeared more genteel than on the previous night and we were enabled to purchase a scanty allowance of provisions, which were in demand and highly acceptable.April 14th Day clear and hot, Left our rancho at an early hour, and proceeded along the base of rugged mountains directly west to within some 5 or 6 miles of the Pacific beach, but not in sight of the ocean, as we came upon a low ground, we passed around the end of those mountains, and travelled over flat planes covered with high grass, and in places pools of Salt water, and yet on this day we did not see the ocean, although at one time we were said to be quite near to the beach. from the edge of a Small Salt lake, I sketched some large and high rocks, which were the terminus of the mountains and nearest to the ocean as in No. 96. I had no time to ascend it, or I may have possibly first beheld the Pacific from its Summet. Again we appeared to direct our course inward from the coast, which brought us in the afternoon to a broad river, with wide beaches of sand and gravel. This stream we forded and entered the pleasant town of Rosario as in sketch No. 97. The location of this town with its mountain scenery was very pretty and interesting. Fruits of every kind with fine mellons were very abundant and cheap in this place. The churchwas large, antiquated, but of handsome finish; up the river about two miles and upon the opposite side, there appeared in full view a similar building of great magnitude, and from its colors and peculiar structure appearing to be much superior to the building in Rosario. Mountains of great magnitude were from 5 to 10 miles to the eastward. In the afternoon we left this pleasant and populous town, and persuing our way among gently rolling hills Palm groves, and vast tracts of brushy oaks, Bodock trees & we encamped at a village of a genteel but  odd appearance; where provisions were plenty, and cheap, and the inhabitants quite friendly. Oranges, mellons &c plentiful. April. 15th  Day clear and hot, persued our course at an early hour, travelling the same routine of plains, rolling grounds, gullies, Palm forrests, &c this day we passed through many miles of Bodock trees, which much resembled an orchard of civilization, extending, far beyond the reach of the eye, with many thousands of bushels of large Bodock apples; I have no doubt but that in time, the seed of these trees will be sought after  for making hedge fences over countries where timber may be scarce. At noon we passed through a fine large townand stopped for a time to refresh ourselves at the market plazas; immense quantities of watermellons were seen in every direction; Soon a large congregation of Ladies, Gentlemen, and civilized looking people came pouring forth from a  large and antiquated church upon the plaza; and people quietly on their way to their houses, though viewing our company with some little surprise and attention. From this town we persued our way over \"slightly rolling\" country of Palms, oaks, and in places a variety of timbers and encamped at night as usual at a rancho. April. 16th Day clear and hot. Persued our journey at an early hour being in full view of Mountains all day, sometimes among hills, and at others upon plains of Palms or extensive groupes of underbrush, with scattering trees of magnitude. The mountain Scene No 98. was sketched this afternoon, from the summet of a Small hill. during the day we passed over several open praries and at night encamped at a rancho of a respectabe appearance beside a fine stream of good water. April 17th Day clear and hot. Persued our journey at Sunrise in order to reach Mazatlan this day. During themorning our road wound considerably amongst small hills, and was sparcely timbered with some Palms, Oaks, &c during the whole day, except where Salt lakes had left level planes of Sand, with not even vegetation Sometimes for miles in some directions upon one of these sand beds, I witnessed to day, what is called mirage, or the deception of water, ahead. For some time I supposed that we were coming to the margin of a lake whose waters were troubled into waves by wind, but on approaching the same, I discovered the mistake; by discovering that the heat of the Sun caused a mist to arise from the sand, which by its position and  reflection to the eye caused the deception called mirage. about noon we arrived in the old village of Mazatlan distant from the present Sea port of Mazatlan, about 24  miles. At present it is a place no importance, and is much dilapidated; we obtained some fruit here and proceeded on our journey to the port of Mazatlan, before leaving this place I sketched the ruins of an ancient church at one corner of the old village Square as in Sketch No 99. Shortly after leaving this place we forded a river, and persued our course over a level ground towards the Pacific OceanSketch No 100. was taken 15 miles from the Port of Mazatlan. Those hills on its back ground are along the Pacific, and several of them stand out in the Ocean. The foreground is a Sandy plain, on which at w, I thought I saw the lake of water, which as I was very thirsty at the time, appeared quite acceptable, and after taking the sketch, I dashed away full speed with my horse, to reach it with the company, but it proved to be a very complete deception of water. Approaching within 8 miles of the Pacific, we came to the bank of a Salt lake, which I sketched as in No 101. showing the distant hills near the port of Mazatlan. At 6 miles I took another sketch as in No 102. whilst we were passing around the Salt lake. The fresh breeze was fanning us from the pacific; the declining Sun was shedding his gentler evening rays upon us from over the hills of the Port of Mazatlan, as we wound our way around that pretty lake before named, and crossing the flats, we arising suddenly upon a high ground came at once in full view of the long sought for port of Mazatlan, and for the first time a broad and beautiful view of the Pacific Ocean, its islands, shipping, and its foaming  surfs that chased each other rapidly upon the pretty beach before us. What a captivating view; two great objects at one view, the Pacific, and the port of Mazatlan  with also the gratification of now closing our land,  journey across Mexico, and again embarking upon the  mighty waters of the Ocean; and thus ending the second great chapter after leaving Philadelphia, and about to  enter now upon a third important change. All  the past toils were passed over without a murmur, when arriving here, none would of course return by the same way should such ever offer, but none were sorry that they had encountered the toils and fatigues of this journey when they knew it had now closed by land, and was about to commence by Sea; and all were of course well pleased and quite merry on entering the town with their prospects of soon being at Sea; and done with Mexico."

    "paragraph": "Having been some time impressed with the belief that a trip to California would be beneficial not only in a pecuniary point of view, but likewise to the better regulation of health and future happenings, I resolved about the 1st of January of 1849 to have my profession that of a Mathematical Instrument Maker and the eve to be remembered Monumental city of Baltimore for a trip to the golden shores of the far western El Dorado. Circumstances favoring, I made preparations in Philadelphia presuming that my trip thither would be made by sea around Cape Horn a distance of 7000 miles in the Ship \"Mason\" which advertised to leave that port several times fixing definite days of departure. Mr W.H. Ogden called upon me requesting my naming in forming a company then to be limited to 10 or 15 select gentlemen. I consented and gave my name as one of the party them numbering three, whose names were W. H. Ogden, B Jay Antrim and W Middleton, the latter of whom had since resigned and remained at his residence in New Jersey. Mr Ogden and myself drew up a notice at Mr Bonsals' Book Store, at No 33 1/2 Market Street, Philadelphia and inserted the same in the \"Ledger,\" and \"North American.\" The advertisment requesting all desirous of making a speedy and an agreeable journey via Matamoras, Monterey, Saltileo, Durango and Mazatlan to California to address \"Camargo,\" at the office's of those two respective papers, which was soon followed by a number of applicants; who were severally visited by Mr Ogden and myself. Mr Jones, of 6th Street, being the first of that number added to our list. We soon procured a room for meeting at No 100 Chestnut Street through the kindness Majors Collins and Ross, where we met in harmony and concert of action until we had completed our company and extended the number of the same to Forty. At one of the Meetings, the name of \"Camargo Company\" was adopted, which is the name of a Mexican town, to which we were first destined from Philadelphia, by sea, and from thence after having procured there our outfit of mules provissions & to proceed overland to Mazatlan via the abovementioned route. Old resolutions adopted in our \"Camargo\" meetings limiting our numbers were several times rescinded and new ones were adopted until our number had increased to forty as before mentioned & Committees of Camp Equipage, provissions, pasports, protections, for chartering a vessel &c all of whoom acted and reported accordingly. Having ascertained that the abovenamed route was infested with hoards of warlike and savage Camanchee Indians, who were committing outrages and massacring those found in their way, and that the same route was in consequence very dangerous, and believing it rash, as also influenced by friends, I withdrew my name from that route, and proposed the Tampico route to the company as the safest, most pleasant, and a shorter land distance than the former; which then being unfavorably received, I withdrew by advice, and my own impressions of that course, and then prepared to proceed around by Cape Horn. In the mien time, the company adopted the Tampico route via San Louis Potosi &c. and —Mr. Ogden called upon me to inform me of it and his desire with many of my old friends was that I should return to the company: and as they had changed the rout to the one I thought most prefferable, I again added my name. Mr Ogden was elected President and myself Secretary of the \"Camargo Company,\" and in my leaving Mr W Robinson, merchant, was elected to supply my place, in which by request and his absence I served several times after my return. A committee appointed chartered the Brig \"Thomas Walters,\" to convey our company of forty to Tampico in Mexico, which was contracted for at $50.00 each, for cabin passage, and the vessel advertised to sail at 8 O Clock A.M. on the 31st of January 1849. Four members declined going with us and three others filled their vacancies. In consequence of some difficulty in entering our articles at the custom house for Mexico, whereby our Captain and vessel was in danger of the laws of Mexico, - our departure was delayed until 9.0.clock A.M. on the following morning the 1st of February. Feb 1st Slight Snow, cold and finally sleety rain; I repaired with all remains of baggage to the vessel at an early hour, and found many congregated to witness our departure. The crowds along the wharves notwithstanding the inclemency of the weather, continued to increase until many hundreds lined the surrounding piers. A few minutes before 9.0.clock our company repaired with arms to two lines upon the Quarter Deck, and fired from guns and pistols a departing salute. Mr Robinson then presented - \"three cheers to our Country\", which our company responded to with warmth - \"three cheers to the friends and dear bonnie lassies, we leave behind,\" and it burst simultaneously from the very hearts of all. - and \"three cheers to Philadelphia\" which we answered appropriately according with our sentiments of the Quaker City. The citizens upon the wharves responded - \"three cheers for the success of the Carmago Company\" followed by a succession of cheers for individuals named in our company, among which the clerk of the Ship \"Mason,\" observing my singular dress in common with my comrades and knowing me, gave \"three cheers for the Buckskin Injnn.\" and thus did our friends cheer us at the hour of separating from all that was dear to us, to embark upon the great and eventful Ocean of future prospects. About, 9.0.clock A.M. the steamboat \"Wave' came beside and before night towed us in co with another vessel as far as New Castle. At New Castle we dropped anchor for the night, and finding a mistake of six packages of provisions which were nescessary for the completion of the captains' manifest for Mexico, it was found requisite to send Mr Thompson, immediately back to Philadelphia in order to bring on the same by express, which he did by an early hour on the following morning, and received a vote of thanks from the company. This evening was spent with considerable spirit and mirth on the part of Messrs Robinson, C. Jones and Bates; which however was excused by the company in general as they were known to be gentleman, and believed to be unaccustomed to such heavy exercises. Besides the leaving of home under the deepest immaginable of melancholly feelings. This day a vote was taken in the affirmative for prohibiting the smoking of cigars in either cabin of the Brig, the quantity of powder and combustibles on board beeing deem'd a sufficient reason. The Roll was called and the following gentlemen answered to their names, --  to wit. Some of our company went on shore at New Castle and made some few purchases of small articles. Have up anchor at an early hour, and got under way towards the breakwater. weather cold and hazy. Proceeded but a short distance this day and cast anchor 2 miles below Reedy Island, in the afternoon where we remained until 4.0.clock the next morning. Weather clear and cold with a North West wind which drove us out the bay in a beautiful and interesting manner with full canvass on a bounding sea. Personal feelings were consulted over the guard in a member of cases, and after, relief expressed. My feelings were much agitated in consequence of the heavy ocean [swells], and I left an elegant dinner of soup and chickens to contemplate the foamingbillows, and returned when convenient to finish the same, which I did in a few minutes with more relish after having cast over a full account much to the relief of my inexpressible feelings. The dinner table was left patronized by our gents than on the day previous, who were also contemplating the foaming billows with the same inexpressible feelings. One instance of inebriation occurred this day which created unpleasant feelings between the captain and said individual, but was amicably settled to the benefit of said person and any of the company, should they in future indulge, which it is presumed they will not doo, as many if not nearly the whole of them, appear to be temperate and sensible men. This evening being much moderated, with a clear and beautiful Moon, most of our party promenade the whole round of the vessel in rapid Military order, whilst the brig bounded upon the long and high Ocean Swells with that majesty becomming the bread bosom of the Atlantic; whilst the spray threw up to the bowsprit and the sheeted sides, it's showery foam, gilded by the silvery rags of the Moon, and followed in the wake  by a long bright trail of foaming ripples receding in our pathway back to the horizon.Our boat dashed on handsomely to the tune of a brisk wind, whilst the music and merry songs of the happier ones arose in concert with the gently whistling winds that playfully tuned their ocean song amid our rigging and canvass. The whole scene was exceedingly  interesting, and the music harmonious,  being sung by good voices, well timed, and filled with the deepest base voice, for a human being that I ever heard, which added greatly to the sweetness of the music; they sang numerous songs that had more richness amid a scene like this, than I had ever before supposed could be the case; I enjoyed it very much. Harmony and quietness prevail generally throughout the cabins, and no discords have occurred this day. A clear, mild, and beautiful morning. I rose early in order to behold the Sun rise over the ocean, which was beautifully decorated  with long light clouds, which partly shaded its disk and gave more glowing colors to the scene; At 10. A.M. a meeting for worship,was called on the after dark, and Revd Mr. Woods,  officiated, assisted by the Revd Mr Blake, nearly each  member attend the meeting; which was conducted  with very creditible solemnity and attention. The  subject was to those who go down upon the great  deep, with a copy of an address delivered by a Revd  gentleman to the young gentleman of Boston, on emigrating  to California, and the choice of good society. A pistol exploded from firing last night, and Mr. Robinson  was cut back of the right shoulder by a piece  at least 5 inches in length, the would though sore  to stay is not however dangerous. This afternoon  many guns and pistols were fired at the little  dog sharks, that are now following our vessel in  numbers; 7 or 8 of which were caught and hauled  on board with fish hooks and lines; they were  usually two feet in length, and bore some resemblance  to the common pike. This afternoon we have  made but little progress, owing to a calm, and  have hardly average 2 knots an hour for half the day,  Towards night clouds arose with sprinkling rain  and there was a general disposition to be in doors. Monday 5th - Up before sunrise and saw the sparkling ocean spray as our galliant boat drove swiftly o'er mountain waves before a fierce gale which changed to a storm by noon, a day long to be remembered by many of our sea sick company. Such a sight all over the Brig, it only kneeds  an old sea faring man to judge of over 30 green ones just ushered to sea in a fierce gale with rain pelting them like so much fine shot; and they bounding sky high on mountain billows. The bounding of our vessel was truly majestic and far beyond what I had ever before witnessed; all sails were tied up and nothing but the small stay sail open to the gale during the afternoon Nearly the whole company were sick, including myself, but I did not so much as loose one meal by it. I soon had an apetite, which was also  the case with many others; few however were at dinner this day. Upon the whole it was a day of miserable sickening, storm, gales and long billows many of which were full 25 feet in perpendicular height.clouds, rain, howling winds and high sea raged all day Tues 6th Beautiful clear morning, after a terrible night of high winds and high billows. To day the ocean moved in immense swells like small hills, with yawning vallies between, but the morning was clear, and the air mild and further fire unescessary. Our stove being upset this morning we did not rectify it, nor feel the need of it. The sick ones are improving and getting lively; the vessel has bounded on beautifully all day, and we crossed the Gulf Stream this morning, winds from the west which drove us out to sea, possibly 350 miles from land, and this evening a little south of the lattitude of Charleston of South Carolina. Saw one sail to the west this morning. Light clouds in the afternoon, and pleasant moonlight evening, with the sea and winds pretty high. Company merry on deck, & Saw one porpose, 5 or 6 nautilus, and gulf weed this morning all interesting to one looking for a subject. It should have been mentioned that Mr. Hewes, one of our company, lost his belt overboard yesterday containing two hundred and twenty five dollars in gold.Wednesday 7th A cloudy morning, high winds and mountain billows; air cool and winds mostly from the west. We bounded on bravely all this day o'er the foaming sea, realing too and fro, with our deck at times almost at an angle of 45, both side ways and lengthwise. The dishes on the dinner table partook likewise of the general commotion. This whole day was another of swift winds, amounting almost to a gale, which stirred up the billious temperaments of our company as usual, and there were many sick ones about deck again as usual. At 12, at noon, we passed a sail in the distance and at 1.0.clock P.M. another to which we hoisted a red flag with red star upon a square white ground, which they answered with the American flag; the winds and the ocean being  to high to speak them. They were bound to the States. We passed them in about Latitude 32 and about 400 miles out to sea from South Carolina. At night the moon rose amid flying clouds, but the air was so cool, the wind so high, and our deck so much wet by the spray from theangry mountaneous ocean, that few remained on deck long; the berths being prefferable. It is not an uncommon thing to hear one or two fall out of their berths, upon the floor, and to observe a general scrambling of boots, hats, trunks, &c for a downhill race to the opposite sides of the cabin whilst cradling upon the high blue  ribs of the ocean. Then occasionally springing a breeze. Thursd 8th Light clouds, air mild, and a pleasant breeze from the North East, with light ocean waves. Held a meeting on financial arrangements on the Quarterdeck at 10.A.M. Saw a ship ahead this morning bound southward in Latitude 29° 40,\" about 400 miles out to sea. Fine sunny day with bland breezes and very light ocean swells. Nearly all of our company are amusing themselves about decks variously. Catching sea weeds, and fifty other little time killing amusements. At 4 O.clock P.M. we held a meeting on the Quarterdeck during which time we elected Mr. Grant, our Captain, for the trip over Mexico to Mazatlan. Mr. McCrellish, 1st Lieutenant, Mr. Hughes, 2nd do Mr. W. H. Ogden the Quarter Master, and Mr. Thompson, the Commissary. It being understood that we go through during our voyage, a regular Military drilling in order to fit us for cases of insurgency in our Mexican Campaign. A pleasant moonlight evening, air mild, with a brisk breeze, and sailing about 10 Knots the hour. Friday 9th A beautiful morning of pleasant breezes; up early and saw the sun rise clear upon the rolling ocean. We sailed beautifully all day with a fine breeze. Things passed off pleasantly and merrily all day, with a mild and elegant moonlight evening; set up until 11.O.clock, hearing and telling wonderful things, which were magic charms, when told by moonlight on so mild and exquisite evening as this, added the gentle undulations of the sea, the fountains of spray, and the bland Zephyrs of the South. Saw a number of white flying fish during this afternoon, which were beautiful and attractive. Sat 10th A clear, warm, and calm morning, sun even getting hot Near, but not in sight of the West Indies. No wind and almost quiet; Ocean almost quiet; This day proved to be a regular calm, and the sun very warm. Coats and vests off, and hardly a breeze. We do not appear to have moved 15 miles all day. A breeze sprung up in the evening and got us under headway at about 5 knots, with a pleasant late moonlight night. A flying fish came on board this evening and was captured. All are well so far on the vessel. Sund 11th Morning warm, clear, and a brisk wind driving us at the rate of 10 knots towards the island with the \"hole in the wall\", but not in sight yet (11 A.M.) Came in sight of the Bahamia island at 1/2 past 11. A.M. but there being a high head wind, we lost all this afternoon and night in tacking too and from the land, with a high sea. Held a meeting  for worship this afternoon at 1/2 past 3.O.clock. Rev'd Mr. Woods delivered a powerful and highly eloquent appeal to our company, with a good effect. A request was sent to our Chaplain (elect) by several individuals, to their discredit, not to hold services on board; but it being overruled by a large majority, services were held as usual. Monday 12th Mild with high head winds, only about 10 miles gained by tacking the whole day. We were insight of the islands several times during the day. At night a black and angry storm rolled over us with rain and fierce winds raising huge billows, howling and tossing us fearfully about on the ocean all night. Silent fear reign'd in our company, but some hardened cases went so far as to make sport in the midst of this exciting scene. Tuesday 13th Passed the \"hole in the wall,\" with light house early this morning. The sun rose beautifully in a fleecy cloud of golden hue, and a brisk wind drove us rapidly towards the Bahamia Bar, the day is clear, mild, and our Brig passed 5 other vessels this morning all bound in the same direction. Arrived at the Bahamia Bar, at 12 Meridian, and crossed it during the afternoon and evening; The water on the Bar is from 15 to 40 feet generally, and sufficiently clear in most places to see bottom at 15 feet. The bottom appears to be composed of white sand, with here and there patches of sponge. The color of the water on the Bar for about 60  miles is a beautiful light Skye Blue, whilst that of the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico is of a darkand blue color. we passed Berry islands this morning and saw there, a number of small sailing craft, and some about a wrecked vessel. A colored gentleman has a very fine farm, and several wives upon one of these singular looking islands. A good breeze drove us on rapidly ahead of all other vessels. The day has been warm clear, and the sun set among gilded clouds showing us a scene exciting universal admiration. Such a glowing sun set scene, few of us have ever before witnessed even in midsummer. There is something exquisite, glowing, brilliant and more diversified with brilliant and unapproachable colors accompanying a sun set scene in this southern chime, that seldom occurs to those farther north, and infinitely above the Artists pencil. [*Wednesday 14th *] Temperature mild, high and favorable wind driving us rapidly to the South west over the gulf of Mexico. No land in sight this morning. Saw several hundred flying fish this afternoon; the vessel appeared to scare them out of the water. We travelled very rapidly all this day and night.[*Thursd 15th*] Morning clear and mild, with a strong breeze driving us rapidly ahead, no land in sight. The gulf is here of a bluish brown appearance and occasionally when the sun is in a certain position of a greenish cast. Our vessel is now dashing off spray and waves of white foam as though she were ploughing by steam. One of our company Mr Chevallier, fell  down our cabin stairs this morning, but was not seriously injured, though stunned by the (long) fall. [*Frid 16th*] Morning clear, warm, and a regular calm. We were lying still at sun rise, but a breeze sprung up during the morning which increased to a strong wind during the afternoon, and drove us forward quite rapidly. This day was warm and clear. Saw many flying fish as usual with some Nautilus, & the Gulf waters appear now nearly black. The spray is flying skye high o'er deck, and we are dashing onward within about 550 miles of Tampico. Cool, high head wind, rough sea and day generally  cloudy, a day of but little interest. Cool, wind from the North, a strong gale with some rain, sea very high and disagreeable. Saw large schools of Porpoises, at several different times playing about the bow of the vessel, flying fish abundant, with occasionally some curious sea birds. This whole day & night has been exceedingly boisterous and unpleasant. Mon.d 19th  Morning clear, air mild, fair wind and travelling pretty fair. The sick ones of yesterday are getting lively again. no land yet in sight. pleasant evening and travelling rapidly ahead. Tues.d 20th  Morning clear, mild, with fair wind and rapid travelling within 200 miles of Tampico. Wed.nd 21st  Warm and clear. Gulf in a calm. discovered  land at 1/2 past 12 P.M. a fair breeze in the afternoon water of the Gulf getting quite green. The coast of Mexico ranges in barren and here and there partly cultivated hills. very Singular scenery. The pilots came out to us at 4 P.M. and took us into Tampico by dark, being up a small and crooked river about 6 1/2 miles. Vegetation &c was all green and the Spring verdure was here in all its richness fully displayed. The breakers running upon the shore were quite interesting and our entranceto Tampico over the bar was quite favorable. The  county about Tampico is in flats and broken hope  and there into low rolling hills of a peculiar  appearance, covered here and there with dense Chaparell. An officer boarded our vessel and examined  our passports, and we anchored off Tampico in the  river Rio Paneuco. Many porposes were playing  in the gulf as we entered the river. it was a beautiful sun set scene, and the weather quite warm.  we were not permitted to go on shore this evening. We have now arrived in Mexico, 20 1/2 days from  the wharf in Philadelphia. Clear. & Warm like August. landed this morning  at 10.A.M. in Tampico. went to the city Plaza and  examined strange costoms, dress, appearances of things &c. wandered with friends about town and suburbs all  day except when our baggage passed the Custom  House, when we had all taken to private rooms  rented for our company. Our impressions of Tampico  and the Mexicans in general, was at first quite unfavorable,  but in a few days becoming more familiarized with their  very singular manners and appearances, we felt more at home Tampico. State of Tamaulipas. Mexico. 23rd For one Real or 12 1/2 cts in company with a friend I crossed the  Rio or river Paneuco, to the shore of the State of Vera Cruz, from which place I sketched Tampico, as per plate No. 1. To a citizen of the States unaccustomed to foreign life, it at once presents an oriental appearance. There are two plaza's or public squares in the city the principal one facing the  river and the other back, upon which two of the Military posts and a small plain cathedral are located. The streets run generally at right angles, and three fourths of the  houses are one story in height, without chimnies, window glass, boards, or brick; being usually constructed either of bamboo, mud, or stone, which are generally plastered upon the exterior surface, and occasionally painted. The roof of each principal dwelling generally partaking of the usual Mexican trait, though more Americanized than  most other Mexican cities. The suburbs are almost entirely composed of cabins of Bamboo, thatched with the leaves of  the palmetto. The city is located upon a slightly undulating ground and almost entirely surrounded by water. The many singular plants with the beautiful flowers and foliage of spring combined with the lively colors of the dwellings, gave to Tampico, a singular and highly interesting appearance. The mainplaza, is paved with limestone (vide sketch No 2.) in the centre of which there is a large circular pediment of limestone rising in 6 steps, upon the summet of which there was once a monument of Santa Anna; which has been destroyed in their Revolutionary events. The building marked No 1. belongs to the British government; it is a costly and handsome establishment, and is  the head quarters for the immense quantities of silver, brought from the mines of San Louis Polosi. The markets are held every morning upon a part of this plaza. It is inferior to those in the States, though more abundantly stocked with the tropical fruits, at much less prices. Beef, fowls, fish, eggs, cheese, beans, peas, yams, tomatoes, &c with Lemons, Oranges, Bannanna's, plantains, sugar cane, coco nuts, with many vegitables supply this market at cheap rates. Almost every article kept by the Grocers, Dry good Merchants, hardware houses and other merchantile establishments of the States may be found here, but some of the are extravigantly dear. The custom house stands upon the main plaza facing a wooden pier upon the river. Coffee, sugar, rice, tea, tobacco and some other articles are virtually prohibited by their duties. Our party had about $20 worth of the essence of tea, the duties of which was over $30. No. 2 is the dwelling of Mr. Chase the American Counsil.The costom house officers are in general exceedingly punctilious and exact, but a small gold piece, has occasionally induced some of them as in other parts of the Republic, to put on  green spectacles. Our company of 40. were all presented to a tall thin and dignified praefect or chief Alcalde, who signed each pasport, for which he charged each $1. We occupied 3 large rooms in a retired part of the city,  near one of the principal barracks, and a part of the  time cooked our own provisions. We saw several military parades, as large forces were temporarily stationed here,  to prevent a rise on the part of the citizens of this city and State for independence, and annexation to Texas, or  in plain words Annexation to the United States. There was a patroll of small parties of Soldiers with  drum, fife, beaugles, &c. at almost every hour of the day. The complexion of the Mexicans is generally copper, bronze, and sometimes almost black. Their hair black and straight and their features partaking much of the Indian. I think  there is a marked difference between the features and the  color of the Spaniard and the Aztec Indian of Mexico, but they are called Mexicans. The real Aztec occupies generally the lower grades of life, but they appear tobe by far the most honest, sociable, polite, and hospitable. Though, as in other countries there are very conspicuous exceptions. The Sabbath is but little observed here, church open with most of the stores &c in the morning, and all closed in the  afternoon, for dances called fandango's, cockfights and other amusements, etc. You can get a good cup of coffee on the  plaza, or at the \"Caffe de Reverdy\" for a maydue or 6 1/4 cts. toast bread 6 1/4 cts. a cup of excellent chocolate one Real. 12 1/2 cts. eggs 12 1/2 cts per doz. about 2 1/2 lbs of coarse sugar for a  Quartee or 3 cent piece of silver. Flour is high, and bread dear. Tortelias are very common, when well made they are excellent, they are simply finely pulverized corn baked in large thin wafers, until they snap like thin sea biscuit. The Mexicans do not generally live as well nor in the  same manner as those of the States with some exceptions. I have however, tasted pastries here surpassing any thing of the  kind in the States. Good wine from 37 1/2 to 75. cts per bottle. Freoles, or black beans, plenty, cheap, and excellent. In  dress they are peculiar, with many varieties of fashion, and possibly as different from the Americans (in general) as may be found throughout the whole world. A tapering and broad rim hat called a Sombrero; often a tight  [*But meals are usually charged from 25 to 50. cts. and their appendages in proportion.*]and curiously figured buckskin jacket, over clean linen,  a pair of figured buckskin pants opening and buttoning up from top to heel, under the right and left arm, being small above and as broad as a Sailor below; they are generally unbuttoned as high as the knee or the pocket, exhibiting a pair of fine white linen pants beneath, which are also quite airy. The Mexicans are very clean in their dress, in this respect they far surpass the United States. Even our servants or mule drivers, were dressed in their  clean white linens; a thing most remarkable for this country considering their state of civilization. The Cargador or porter will carry a box or package, and yet appear not to soil his fine linen. The high tariffs of Mexico, prevent  the coarser articles from being imported, consequently the  Mexican markets abound with the finest foreign goods. The cloth, or linen is confiscated if it does not count so many threads to the inch when passing the custom house. Lands held in this country from old titles is good, but that from the government is not safe. Mr. Chase, our American  consul, says that during his stay of 15 years at Tampico, he has known the Mexican government to change 16 times consequently their laws, &c. are but temporary powers of vacilationIt is necessary to have a pasport to enter this country which will cost $2 in the States, to countersigned by the Alcalde of each large town you pass through within 48 hours after your arrival, costing at each place 25.cts. with also a pasport to leave the country; A passport to carry arms, and a passport to carry any amount of money beyond your expenses, at 25 per cent discount. Owing to the  reports respecting the country we had to pass over to San Louis Potosi, 5 of our number withdrew and proceeded by themselves. Mr Grant, then withdrew with a large portion of our company, leaving us but 19, which embodied a separate  mining company, having with them a large amount of mining tools, provisions, medicines, etc. amounting to considerable baggage which the other division thought would detain them some weeks longer in getting through to Mazatlan; consequently that party of 16 organized and proceeded some 5 days in advance of us, and procuring their horses at Mr. Laflers Rancho, or farm, they proceeded with dispatch to San Louis Potosi etc. Our party after selling off some unnecessary articles (as every pound to Mazatlan cost us 40 cts.) proceeded on the journey, having obtained our horses of Mr Lafler; 16 miles up the river of Paneuco. The other party of course expectedto be in San Louis Potosi, at least for 8 days ahead of our tardy mules and mustangs. They arrived in San Louis Potosi on the evening of the 21st of March, and our party at sun rise next morning to their surprise, as this journal from Tampico, will show. During our stay in Tampico, many of our party formed acquaintances in this city friendly to the Americans, a disposition evinced throughout the state of Tamaulipas. The weather here is quite as hot as august in the States,  but a fine sea breeze comes from the Gulf of Mexico, every afternoon; that makes our perambulations about town more pleasant. The Senioretta's or Ladies wear no bonnets, but invariably shawls upon their heads, I have seen some that were very beautiful; the early evening is their favorite time of appearance. This is decidedly a great country for moschitoes, ticks, and all kinds of loathesome vermin as we will herein after prove. The States bear not the slightest resemblance in species, quantities, and qualities to them, as they are positively the most numerous and most troublesome inhabitants of Mexico. To pick off 3 or 500 ticks from your pants and coat, as the cost of a venture in some places among the small weeds and bushes, might seem unreasonable, but such is very possible to occurSund 25th  The Priest, has extended an invitation to our company to  attend church. I visited and found but few present. The church is handsomely decorated inside but has a very  antiquated appearance without.  26th No rain and weather excessively warm, and moschetoes  innumerable, and insupportable. I repaired to the bluff  on the river, and from the highest part of it sketched  scene No 3, which comprehends an extensive and interesting  range of country. The first river to the right passing north  is the Rio Tamosee. West of it is the rio Paneuco,  a beautiful little stream meandering off towards San  Louis Potosi, and navigable 150 miles for light draught  boats, through no steamers have yet ascended it for. at fig. 1  is Laflers' Rancho 16 miles up the river; west of it for about  20 miles there is a level prairie. The Mountains fig. 2.  are interesting, as they abound with numerous ancient  walls, curiosities, and remains very similar to those discovered  in Yucatan, by Stephens. An ancient city is  supposed to have covered a number of square miles  on the summet of this mountain; which has been described by Norman of New Orleans. Beyond this west by south  two peaks of immense and distant mountains may be seen  occasionally by a clear sun set.South (fig 3) There is a long and beautiful Lagoona or Lake being about 2 miles wide, beyond it in the direction of Vera Cruz, there are high mountains and fertile plains. In the foreground there is a long tract of prarie, covered with the wild prarie grass, some chaparell bushes, with occasional  patches of low timber, and skirted on the margin of both waters with brushy trees, and one Rancho or (small) farm. [*Mond March 5th*] Weather warm, and yet no rain, but a pleasant  breeze each afternoon. Having all baggage in readiness and our bargains completed for horses and mules, we  embarked with everything belonging to our party in large canoes, in which we made the best of our way up to Laflers' Rancho 16 miles up the Rio Paneuco, to his principal farm or Haciendo, which I sketch'd as in No 4. Showing the Paneuco river, the neighboring mountain which contains its ancient remains of a past city on it and the curious forest in its foreground. This is the  best house on this river. This gentleman is an extensive landholder, his personal property extends  over more than 50 square miles, which he says he purchased some 12 or 14 years ago for $800. He came here originally from the State of Ohio. He has an immense tract, stock, grain, servants &c.and raises Sugar Cane, Coffee, bannanas, Corn, and  many other things, and is the only person I see about  this section of the country making brick. During our  short stay at this pleasant rancho, Mr Thompson, one of  our party obtained a guide over the river, and proceeded out to the ancient city upon the mountain; he reports the way to be difficult and exceedingly unpleasant, but he considered himself amply repaid in beholding some of the  scattered remains of old stone walls, parts of dwellings, implements &c. I was informed in Tampico, that a large  block of stone, appearing to have been part of a monument, was raised there, with an inscription upon the under surface, below it there was another similar block, which has not yet been removed. There are many very interesting matters there for the Antiquarian: Mr  Thompson having shot a deer, returned at Sun set with it, which  was very acceptable to our company. Our party were very much annoyed by clouds of voracious moschetoes, and other exceedingly repugnant insects swarming upon all the undergrowth and weeds of this region of country. At this Haciendo, our dinners were of the best the  country afforded, including a great variety of new dishes.Tuesd 6th Day clear and very warm; our baggage was repacked and carefully weighed; and likewise assorted for mule loads. Horses, mules, and pack saddles was the business of the day Wed 7th Day clear and hot. This morning opened with the buz of preparation for marching to Mazatlan; but for many unprepared considerations, it was postponed one day. Thursd 8th Day clear and hot. Having hired our mules, mustangs and four servants from Mr Lafler, and our guide Don Francisco, being in command as director of our order of march, as interpreter, Sub Commissary &c. and our other officers being elected -- and having carefully loaded all our arms -- we commenced our line of march, -- at 10 A.M. upon an extensive levil and variegated prairie. Westward ho! all in lively spirits; the first large city to which we  looked forward with interest, was San Louis Potosi,  a distance from Tampico of about 350 miles, though variously estimated from 3 to 400 miles according to route. The appearance of our company completely equipped with with guns, rifles, revolvers, knives, swords, &c. was anything but pleasant for a guerrilla to look at, some of which we anticipated meeting. half the day we marched upon a prairie plain, a part of whichhad no timber and scarcely any vegetation. We passed a  pleasant little lake upon which there was an immense quantity of wild game, that was easily approached. in the afternoon we got among some woodland hills, with  a small allowance of very bad water. Our road was only  a very indifferent mule path, and not passible for a  vehicle of any kind, and continues thus quite to S.L. Potosi. On the way we saw immense droves of cattle and horses, roving at large upon the prairies. In the afternoon we  passed a caravan from San Louis Potosi. The road being very dusty, the sun excessively hot, water scarce and bad,  and but little available shade; we were of course quite glad to close this days journey, in camp at a small bamboo hut, on the bank of the Rio Paneuco. - and an  interesting group of dusty travellers we were too, with  a regular saw mill appetite. Freoles, or black beans, with  coffee and corn tortelias, were served round for supper, and notwithstanding they were previously out of credit; they passed very current on this occasion. Our beds and blankets were then spread at random upon the  ground in the open air; and a guard of two set, for every two hours of the night, on the first of which I served two  hourswith my comrade Mr Bods, being from 8 to 10. An early Moon rose upon the meandering and placid waters of the beautiful Rio Paneuco, and a gentle breeze played  fitfully in the overarching foliage around over camp. This was a fit time to remind one of those pleasant evenings at home, of scenes in our native land. Friday 9th Day clear & hot. Got on march before daylight and marched 9 leagues, (27 miles) through a hot sun, dusty paths, winding hither and thither over small hills and bushy plains of no peculiar interest, with no dinner  and a short allowance of very bad limestone water. This evening we anchored again a bamboo cabin, on the banks of the Rio Paneuco, very similar to the last, and found a very short allowance of provisions at  this place. A part of our party went into the river to bathe and found the water quite warm. They were cautioned  however about Alligator gars &c, which are  sometimes dangerous. We camped again in the open air. Sat 10th Day clear & hot. Commenced our march before daylight; being 7 leagues (21 miles) for the day. Travelled most of this day over plains, covered with forest of  palm trees, with dense undergrowth of palmettos.from which the palm fans are made, this change of  scenery was new and very interesting to us. It reminded  me much of the descriptions of palm forrest in Africa and  India, frequently for miles we saw no other trees than  several varieties of the palm, sometimes scattering, and  at others compact reminding one too of the Jersey pines, when seen at a distance. These palms afford but little shade, and grow here usually to the height of from 40 to 50 feet, without branches or leaves, save only upon their very summets. An American unaccustomed to such  very singular scenes cannot comprehend fully from description the majesty they impose at first sight upon the mind of the lover of the wild in Nature. View us winding our way in single file, with baggage mules in advance, with coats off, and red flannen, as  conspicuous; with arms glistening in the mid days sun, the arrearo's or mule drivers singing out with their incessant \"mulah\", the guide ahead  smoking his cigaretto, or little paper cigar, and the  rest of the travellers following like a flock of spring birds in complete tune, and merry felicity, among dust, sunshine, and the shadeless forrests of palm. [*20*] In places however the palms, and palmettos arched over our road.and gave us a partial shade for a short period, then we would come up on an open plain, followed by a regular forrest of various trees, massive, dense, and overgrown with immense vines, and peculiar trees for occasional undergrowth; next a few small hills, then a brushy plane, followed again and again with the forrests of palm. Parrots and many other birds of gay plumage were very abundant and exceedingly noisy. Here and there the grass and brush have been fired and burned off for many miles. We encamped again at a bamboo cabin on the Rio Paneuco, very similar to the last, here again most of our party bathed in the river. I saw some diminutive watermellons at this Rancho, and helped to taste one. Our fare at this place was reasonable, but charges superior. The water is still very indifferent and strong of limestone. 11th Day clear and hot. Started early for a Rancho on the  Tamouin & Paneuco. 9 leagues (27 miles) The scenery of this day was much diversified and interesting with palms, plains, hills, gullies, brushes, and forrests. Among which I saw very many curious Banyan trees, or the wild figg tree. So curious were they, that if time had permitted I should have, certainlysketched a number of them. I think it is the same species of the Banyan tree of India. I saw several  cases of palm trees completely imbedded in the very trunks of immense Banyan trees, and being quite ornamental  to it. This tree returns from its from its branches direct  in a perpendicular line very frequently to the ground  in long cords like ropes, which take root and spring up again, in many shapes and sizes, and in many  cases more than a hundred times from one large tree. On this days march we saw several curious Mounds. We arrived at the Tamowin about 3.P.M, and after sending all baggage over with ourselves in [a] canoes,  we finished our crossing by swimming the horses & mules,  on the opposite bank we encamped at a large and  good looking Rancho, being at the junction of the  rivers Paneuco and Tamowin. Here we purchased a calf of good size for $.3.00, and prepared him accordingly, for further use upon the way. Water still unpalatable. This evening a part of our company were in to swim again. From circumstances we inferred trouble with guerrillas, but the guards were vigilant, and we left at 1.O.clock next  morning winding over way through a forest by moonlight.Mond. 12th Day clear & hot. Proceeded by early moonlight (1.O. clock) on our way for Villa de Viase. At sunrise we arrived at the first- Mountain on our way called the \"Siera Madre\" or Mother Mountain. Before entering the pass, the traveller will find a valuable warm Sulpher Spring, of great medicinal properties not far from the path. As you approach the pass, the scene is peculiar. You walk and lead your Mustangs over a rocky path, of such barbarous rudeness that you may deem it a venture for a Mountain goat, and yet your horse must be taxed with all his personal wits to puzzle his way out over loose rocks that edge over the precipice of an almost bottomless uncertainty. The mules, -they are as sharp as Chatham Yankees, for they will carry a load, where a common man would want room to tout over his own shadow. They are perfect baggage wild cats, and climb rocks with heavy loads as if they had claws, or were cammels in the desert of Arabia. We passed over one high and exceedingly dangerous precipice,  and other unpleasant places, and finally passed through a very narry and precipitous valley that meandered like the bed of a little river diagonally across the mountain, with almost the slightgrade of a rail road, and generally not much over 300 feet in width, but steep and of great height with timber on each side edging up the mountains, the meanderings of this cavern-valley  with its hight cliffs, and little coves and passes, gave to the whole scene a peculiar wildness and Sublimity. We scared up five young deer among the rocks; It was in this mountain pass that from report, we first  anticipated some Mexican Indians, or Guerillas; in this pass they could sweep and be safe; and although our guns were several times fired, none made their appearance to us. After crossing the mountain pass, we came upon an undulating country still uninhabited, though in many places of a very rich soil, covered sometimes with good timber and now and then prarie grass, with occasional barrens of wild and cavernous limestone rocks. Entrances to caves are to be seen, and in one place a romantic spot, an immense well of an oval form descends perpendicularly through limestone rocks to a great debth. Some ancient trees bend gracefully over and around its mouth. To day also, I found the remains of an ancient town and the appearance of an ancient fort on our way to the village de Viase. Revd Mr Woods and myself passed on in the advance of the trainMarch, 1849.  a mile or two, with the view of arriving at the village in  advance of the train. on the way just as we had pas a  slight bend of the road, we saw five uncouth looking Mexicans sitting on the bank of a dry creek; the wispered suspiciously until we came beside them, when they all arose at once with sticks, and gathered around us, supposing something rong on foot, I drew my gun from its sheath, and exhibited also my revolver and knife. Mr Woods prepared himself also by exarming his gun &c. These fellows followed us a short distance evidently meditating our arms, when they fell  off from us on being told that many Americans were just behind. We arrived in the village early in the afternoon, and found Mr Grants division just on the point of leaving for S.L. Potosi. This being the place where all our horses had to be shod for the mountains to come. We encamped on the village plaza, pitched our tents, prepared our own food, &c. Tuesd 13th Day hot and clear, examined the appearance of the village with friends, and obtained a good bowl of coffee two eggs and bread on the plaza for 1 Real, 12 1/2 cts. We have discovered that  Milk, Eggs, freeoles, tortelias, Oranges, and Coffee may be  readily obtained at almost every place; all of which  are very cheap, except coffee. On the Plaza of thisvillage there stands the remains of an Ancient Catholic Church. The Cupola is yet in a tollerable State of preservation and 3 bells yet hang in it of a very Anti- quated appearance. Upon its summet shrubs, cactus, grass may be seen as luxuriant as upon Terra firma. Vide sketch No 5. To the right of it is a long bamboo  building thatched with palmetoes; in it the Catholic citizens hold their Service. From appearances within we judge this chappel to contain more real wealth than many of those magnificent edifices of the States. This day was occupied in Shoeing our horses. Mr. Lafler of Tampico came in the village some 90 miles from his Rancho in order to have them properly attended too, the Shoes having been brought here from Tampico. The price of Shoeing here is from 3 to 5 dollars per horse, in the States about one dollar. Here they most generally throw the animal upon the  ground and tie him there with ropes. The Smith shops and other mechanical departments appear more like burlesques than the representation of a half civilized people. This morning I ascended the cupola of the plaza ruins and then beheld a beautiful view of the Siera Madre Mountains 12 miles westward as in Sketch No. 6.The foreground from the mountain was nearly a levil plane, intersperced here and there with apparent clearings, which in several cases proved to be small open and natural praries, probably never cleared by the hand of man, as they were not much used. A small rapid and romantic river passes under a deep bluff beside the village, where our party were again into bathe, as the day was excessively hot and the water agreeable. The peaks of the Siera Alta, appeared like a cloud in the distance. In offering a pass to the  traveller these mountains are very high and formidable. Just as I had completed this sketch the priest of the parish a very pleasant man ascended the tower and expressed much pleasure at finding me sketching, and thereupon requested me to descend and dine with him, to which I complied with much pleasure, in descending the tower in a shady recess, he placed my arms around  himself he also embraced me, with much feeling, and said that he liked the Americans. His dinner was served  up in the best Mexican style, with wine and numerous new dishes, served in about 8 or10 changes of plates. I left much gratified with his hospitality. Our horses being in readiness, at 4.P.M. we commenced our marchtoward the foot of the Siera Madre Mountains. In leaving and crossing the river by the ford, it was very gratifying to see about 90 or 100 Mexicans upon the high bluffs and along the road to see us out and bid us a friendly adieu, and Adios, adios, adios, was echoed here, there and yonder, which signifies - \"to God\"- we commend you. We travelled some 10 miles this evening and camped in a wild spot about 2 miles from the foot of the mountain. My sketchbook, a satchell, and a coat belonging to Mr Sayre, were lost after dark before camping, but 3 of us returned by moonlight before sun rise and found them. Our camp fire looked really interesting this evening with the sentinals parading around the sleepers who where rolled  up in blankets; who constantly watched among the timbers and bushes for enemy and wholves, the latter of which made themselves known before daylight. [*Wedn 14th.*] Day hot & clear. Arose before before daylight and proceeded to the Siera Madre Mountain. As we ascended, I observed numerous scattering mounds, parts of old walls &c, the timber became large and dense. I believe that there is a spring (the only one from Tampico to S Louis Potosi) not far from the road to the right as you ascend the mountain.our path over the mountain was in ascent by windings about 3 miles, and nearly the same in descending over the opposite side and other hills. The whole scenery was wild beyond description. Could this road or path be exhibited in a civilized country, it would be considered dangerous even for a mountain goat; how then shall I describe it, when a painter would consider it beyond a just representation if skillfully drawn. We lead our horses up the  steep precipitous masses, jumping and scrambling from  rock to rock sometimes two feet perpendicularly. The most ragged and cragged ledges, holes, chasms, and peaks that  the mind could picture for feats in horsemanship. Reader! you have doubtless seen nominally bad roads in the States, but they convey only a faint idea of the  hardships you must encounter in passing the formidable crags upon these mountains of distracted rudeness. Having surmounted the first Series, we descended upon  similar sharp and pointed edges into a wild and  romantic cove, leading off over and around other more  passable hills, in full view of numerous mountains ranging at random in every direction, until we reached the Ranch la Pier, by a small lakeupon a beautiful plane, and here we encamped for the night, having arrived early in the afternoon. The proprietor of the Rancho, is an Alcalde of wealth, and a man of affable manners. Before sun set we ascended a neighboring hill and sketched scene No. 7. including a large assemblage of distant mountains. The setting sun cast back their shadows upon the planes, as I descended, and lent a passing beauty to them ever to be remembered. From advice given us by the Alcalde, it was thought advisable to change our rout over the mountains to San Louis Potosi, by a nearer and more safe direction. The Mexican forces, and Indians or Guerrillas, being  upon the regular route, which would cause us trouble. The first division having gone that way unadvised, they met with difficulties, detention, and considerable danger. Thurs 15th Day clear & hot. Entered upon the nearer route, and passed palm forrests, old fortifications, and a fine little river, where  we filled our canteens with refreshing and cool water, the best from Tampico, and accomplished a long march and 6 or 7 formidable mountains of worse paths than any previously travelled. To describe our labours on these volcanic rocks of gothic masonry, would be romantic indeed.but suffice it to be said that this days march was  the most wild rugged and exhausting of any to San Louis Potosi. On this route I had the pleasure of discovering a  magnificent cavernous Amphitheatre of several thousand feet in diameter, and about 300 feet in perpendicular  debth, covered below with dense timber, and overhung with high arching cliffs of great magnificence. Our mountain scenery today was exceedingly grand though we enjoyed it but little owing to the difficult passes to be encountered. Many of the mountains had no timber, nor even vegetation upon them; being vast masses of rude brown rocks particularly upon their summets. Had time permitted, I should have sketched some of these alpine scenes of barrenness for the information and curiosity of my friends and readers. They are totally unlike anything I ever before saw  in point of complete barrenness and appeared really savage. At sunset we descended into a romantic valley and wound around several Sugarloaf hills, by dark into the beautiful village of San Nicholas, where we encamped upon a pleasant plaza of grass in the midst of the village and at the foot of a large and imposing mountain.but suffice it to be said that this days march was the most wild rugged and exhausting of any to San Louis Potosi.

Whilst watering our horses at a pond in this valley, two suspicious Mexicans appeared, one over the pond, and the other near us apparently examining our arms, &c. and in a short time one of them made bold to tell two of our party that  he was one of a party defeated by the Mexican Government, and that they were many, who were now in persuit of  plunder, both of them were handsomely dressed, and rode upon first class animals. We turned to the left from this interesting valley, through a pass in the hills similar to  No 9. when we came in view of the beautiful and-- romantic village of Tortugas, or village of turtles, where we arrived at 4 P.M. and located ourselves in a  small brush school house, upon a small riding ground well adapted to defence, as an attack of the Guerrillas was looked for, as quite certain during the night. Many of the inhabitants collected around us with curiosity and pleasure, as they hoped we would be of service to them in case of an attack of the Guerrillas or robbers. We were all in anticipation of a fight, when we saw a small fire upon the summit of a neighboring mountain, supposed to be a signal light. Guns, pistols &c were allwith here and there patches of stunted vegetation, growing among the wild mountain rocks. Among these I saw a number of strange and interesting trees, curious plants, magueys, palmettoes, coco's, and a strange fruit resembling the pine apple, being twice as large, and filled with numerous small soft white fruits, much resembling in appearance and taste the common chesnut, which were very abundant on one of the mountains. I also saw a shrub or bean plant bearing flowers, resembling skeins of white & red silk, from 1 to 2 inches in thickness, and from 4 to 6 inches in length. On this days march we passed through many very peculiar mountains, scenes of interest. No 9 (sketch.) was taken on horseback whilst passing into the valley of corn. No 10. is a view of the Valle de Maise, or valley of corn, looking to the north. This valley is about one mile in width, and many in length. The hills upon either side are nothing of nearly void of vegetation, the whole valley is divided into large fields for corn, and well improved with stone fences. The soil is rich and corn flourishes here luxuriantly. Far on the northern horizon a high mountain wasall of which grew from 4 to 15 feet in height, and chiefly among the interstices of the rocks. It appeared to be a  section of country almost useless for any purpose, and it  really appeared strange, how such a barren wilderness of  of thorns could be at all inhabited where water was  also very bad and scarce; in the afternoon we travelled among clouds of dust, with a hot sun and but little breeze. before sunset we encamped under a tree, beside, a desolate mud dwelling upon a deasert plane, much like a scene in the desert of Arabia, appearing quite as barren and  forlorn, as the immagination could well picture as in sketch No 13. A large old fashioned rope and pulley well, was in the  vicinity, at which about 40 Mexican women, were engaged in drawing water, and carrying it away in large earthen jars upon their heads, bearing a striking resemblance to the old Egyptian costoms, in dress, color, and manners. At this place we fared slim and paid well for it. Sund 18th   Day clear and warm. Proceeded on our journey at 6.A.M. very  anxious to get out of this barren and sandy wilderness. and travelled nearly all day over diversified planes of  limestone, palms, maguays, casters, some timber, and for a  mile or two, for the first time a woodland of beautiful cedars.put in the best order, our camp fire put out, and two guards put on duty. The Alcalde paid us a friendly visit, and many of the inhabitants brought us cheap provissions, and the night passed off without trouble. [*Sat. 17th.*] Day clear and warm. The inhabitants came in numbers to bid us a friendly adios. I pencil'd sketches No 11. and 12. just before leaving showing on No 11. our position in camp at the school house, and an opposite view looking South. Oranges flourish here, and are  very cheap, eggs are plentiful, with many useful articles of provissions. Soon after leaving this pleasant village, we ascended several large and barren hills, and in a few hours descended a very romantic pass down upon prarie plains and cultivated fields. our views on this days journey were extensive new diversified and interesting. We came to a  small village of a very romantic appearance, beside a little stream of water, where at first the inhabitants were much terrified at our appearance. We saw but little timber, during the whole day, the planes and  hills, being almost covered with wild cactus, prickley pears, and the short scrubby palms, etc.At intervals for several miles, the ground was as white as the very snow of a northern winter, having a saline taste, in places, in others that of Epsom Salts, and as fine as the very best flour. Caverns were beneath, for we  could often hear the footsteps of our horses echoing beneath, and now and then a chasm or deep pit would  appear. When timber appeared in the usual form of groups or clusters, it usually had a singular appearance, much resembling extensive Apple, and  Peach orchards. The country had conspicuous marks of a volcanic origin upon a limestone foundation. We were almost constantly in sight of distant ranges of lofty and rugged mountains, lending romance to the day. and now and then large planes, covered with prairie grass would extend for before the eye to the mountains skirted here and there with pleasant shady woodlands. We arrived at the Hacienda about 4. P.M. and were  gratified to find it a place much superior to the last,  not only for provisions, but also for shade and comfort. About 9.O.clock this morning we arrived at a place on the valley plane, where a stream of clear and very strong limestone water meandered from a small lake, and in a short distancedisappeared beneath the ground; this water though clear and cold, was so strongly impregnated with the Carbonate of lime, that though we were very thirsty, we could scarcely drink it. During a temporary halt, I sketch'd this lake No. 12 [*14*], and its vicinity southward. Game was plentiful here, and  several of our party delay'd some on account of it. Mr Sherman, one of the same , remained there so long that  in persuit of our caravan he missed the path and  was lost for a day and a half suffering greatly from exposure and other great dangers; after some delay, expense,  and trouble in scouring the country in various directions with a Mexican guide, he was at last found, much fatigued frightened, and sick, having encountered considerable perils. I remained some time behind the company in waiting for  Sherman, as long as I felt it safe from missing the way  myself, expecting him to come up upon this path, [during that time I sketched scene No 14. a high] on our right there was a high mountain [to] [the North] bearing the marks of a large volcano. Some of our party were in to bathe again this evening, but as our journey has elevated us much, the water is now becoming cooler especially each night, which is cold enough for two or three blankets, whilst  the mid day sun is quite hotMond 19th Day warm and clear. Proceeded on our journey at 7.O. clock. sMuch of this days journey was very similar to the last, at times winding among barren hills, small planes of cactus, thorns scattering palms, gullies and rocks, with small groves of peculiar trees of a stunted growth. Before sun set we crossed a beautiful and fertile plane under cultivation with corn, and haulted for a short time at a large well on one of the fields one and a half liles from, and in full view of the beautiful little town of Ceretus de San Juan; at the suburbs of which we encamped within a large yard for the  night. Before day light had left the hills of Ceretus, I passed through several parts of the town, and Sketched the church and plaza as in No 15. Showing the valley and hills eastward, over which we had passed during the after part of the day. The appearance of this little town is quite genteel the houses being mostly constructed of Stone and frequently whitewashed and as often secluded in pleasant Shady yards and groves of the trees and shrubs peculiar to this country.Tuesd 20th  Day warm and clear. Proceeded on our journey at 6.O.clock. Just as we were leaving the yard the horse belonging to Mr Thompson, taking fright at some object ran off through the yard, and brok his rifle into many small pieces, Mr T.--escaping unhurt. About 1 mile from  Ceretus, looking westward, I sketched scene No 16. showing the barren hills, a hacienda to the right, and the little clusters of bushes, dotting the ground like miniature islands. We were among the hills and ravines all day, and passed up one very interesting pass between barren mountains which was several  miles in length. On the way before entering this pass,  and at the commencement of a fine broad road, we  halted for a short time at a large Hacienda, called San  E Pedro No 17. having westward a beautiful mountain view, south the cultivated fields and distant hills, and around the dwelling several beautiful groves, over the principal door was painted in large letters, \"Casa Particular\". It being a public house or hotel of the  Mexican order. Having ascended through peculiar scenes of the passes, to the summet of the mountains, we then passed a long time over a wild rocky and entirely desolatewilderness, almost entirely destitute of the smallest vegetation, except in some particular spots, where small stone & mud huts of misery were now and then to be seen. Before descending we passed a small mud village in a little rocky and desolate ravine; with only a few cactus, thorns, and stunted brush, but no regular timber about it. It looked much like solitude and misery. The road has now become excellent, and for the first time we found it graded and paved as a regular road up the mountain. Wooden crosses are plentiful and conspicuous, they are more numerous now than on the way back to Tampico; Sometimes two or three in sight of each other may be seen and particularly on this days march. We are told that these crosses are erected upon the particular spots, where travelers have been murdered. if so, this is decidedly a great country. As we descended the mountain, winding our way down a dangerous pass, a beautiful plane, with a range of barren mountains 15 miles westward, appeared before us, which I hastily sketched as our party descended to the plane, as in number 18. This plane is about 15 miles in width, and almost entirely covered with a brush peculiar to this country.This plane, of the valley is quite level and of very great length, the camino that crosses it, is at least 100 feet broad, and would be an elegant road for travel if not so abundantly supplied with dust and sand. Our party were so much enveloped in dust, that during a portion of the time some of them were not distinguishable at the distance of a few rods. Clouds of dust arose high in the air, and marked in places the spots where persons were moving on many parts of the plane. Such scenes have however been long familiar to us from the very city of Tampico. At sun set we arrived at the \"Meson De Fern\" a public house called Pestelius located in a desert of sand, a few miles from a village to the north west and off from the road. At this place, we found Capt Grants' division of the Camargo Company, who met us in a sociable manner as old friends, the two divisions having taken different roads to San Louis Potosi.. Mr Chevallias' party of 5 having also arrived the whole Camargo Company were again together. At night, a high wind arose and gave us a complete storm of dust, exceeding anything of the kind that I have ever before witnessed in any country, reminding one of the desert of Arabia.Wednd 21st Day warm and clear. Capt. Grants division, left before sunrise in order to reach San Louis Potosi before night. Our company proceeded on the way an hour after, as we did not design pressing our horses and mules with a very long days march. Nos 19 and 20 are exterior and  interior views of the desert house where we camped. To the right of the house, there is a large well, which is deserving of notice; two or three hoses are fastened by beams to a vertical shaft, which by 8 right angle sticks move a horizontal beam, to which there is a wheel about 12 feet in diameter, with ropes and  about 20 leather buckets, for raising water from the  well to a trough, and from thence into a stone bason  about 60 feet square, and 8 or 10 feet in debth. This water was fair and cool, and very desirable for the country. Such wells are not frequent, and found only occasionally at the large Haciendo's or Ranchoe's of the wealthy. Water on this road from Tampico to  San Louis Potosi, is scarce, and in almost every instance very unpalatable, muddy, and dangerous to the stranger. It is therefore nescessary for travellers to be cautious in drinking the water along this route                                                                      in particular. This days journey was very similar to the last, with hills and dusty roads, with a hot sun, brushy planes, thorns, and large cactus of various forms, &c. Mountains of barren rocks were seen all day, but we travelled chiefly upon the planes. About 4 in the afternoon we arrived at the Rancho de los Soledad, previous to which I sketched scene No. 21 as we descended to the valley in which this rancho is located, This plane is very wide, and a very considerable length, on this plane about 30 miles to the left is located the city of San Louis Potosi, in full view of large Mountains, though not within several miles of any of them. No. 22 is a sketch of the Haciendo or \"Rancho de los  Solidad\", and its neighboring mountain, which I sketched before sun set, this scene is looking S. East. We encamped opposite to this in a large Mud wall with appartments for travellers as in Sketch No. 23. The inhabitants are now becoming less friendly than they were back over the mountains. And are decidedly against the Americans in the popular feeling, and have occasionally expressed those feelings with insults, and a few words of contempt, which some of them have learned from the American deserters, in the English language. We have seen a number of these contempitible shadows of white men and almost as often heard their curses, or indecent language, but we have generally left them unnoticed. At this rancho we saw a large amount of arms and lances, with an American Rifle, pistols, swords &c which led us to suspicion the character of the place strongly; we however kept our Arms and Sentinels in good trim, and were ready at the word, to show them that in defence we were the same original Americans that they might have before read about. Had our numbers been small enough to suit their taste, I have no doubt but that a fight would have resulted judging from all circumstances, questions, &c. Being in the neighborhood of S. L. Potosi, it is now absolutely nescessary to be constantly on your gard for all shapes of thieves, Robbers, Guerillos, &c., etc, etc. who appear to compose a large proportion of the population. [*Thursd 22nd*]  We left the Rancho, this morning at 3. O. clock for San  Louis Potosi, the road was broad, and lined with cactus, from 5 to 15 feet in height. We were all awake for any attack on the way. Having travelled 15 miles by 1/2 past 8.O. clock A.M. we entered the Splendid and singular city of San Louis Potosi, having passed through a beautiful little village before entering Potosi. The city is situated upon a large and beautiful plane, which is under good cultivation, and is for several miles in every direction; divided into regular right angle  \"streets and roads. The fences of the roads, if they may be so called are composed of the high pentangular cactus, growing in single stems of about 5 inches diameter to a  height of about 8, 10, or 15 feet, and frequently so close together that it is generally capable of shutting out the smallest animal. The average width of the streets are about 30 feet. A member of large and handsome species of trees range along them, with which I am not familiar, one of which resembles in bark, limb, and  site, the Locust, with leaf of a small fern. Another, has the shape and height of a poplar, with the denseness of the black thorn hedges of the States; it is a  beautiful tree of a dark green color, and very ornamental. The maguay is another peculiar plant, very abundant here; I have seen fences made of them extending many miles at a time, and very common everywhere  onour way from Tampico. All these interesting plants, trees &c. with a large number that would be  difficult to describe, but which nevertheless are exceedingly beautiful, belong to this country and are so abundant as at times to cover many miles in compact masses, so much so that it would be difficult for a man to pass among them as they all, with but little exception possess luxuriant crops of  thorns. All these species crowd the roads and surround the fields as you pass into San Louis Potosi. I also for the first time saw two peach trees in full blossom in a beautiful garden at the suburbs of the city. And many beautiful flowers of singular beauty were in full bloom likewise and filled the air with the richness of their morning fragrance. Several fine fields of ripe barley added to the view, their mellow orange hues, whilst, the plough (a rude woodden concern) was busy beside. The Orange, Lemons, and fig trees were also handsome when blended with their fruits, beneath other more conspicuous trees, among which was one called the Peru, another the China tree, andyet another larger and decorated with more exquisite brilliance than I have ever before witnessed. all these with their charming colors and luxuriance bent gracefully over our dusty roads as we passed into the great central metropolis of Potosi. The morning sun had already arrisen upon the domes, towers and minarets of Potosi, as our company entered it from the North. There was so much of the grand and the humble combined, that I could not but remark its resemblance to what I had read of St Petersburg and Moscow, as described by travellers in Russia. After wending in single file our tortuous way amid dense crowds of strange brown faces, around the various streets of the city we at last took up our quarters at the St Anthony house, which was commodious and  constructed strictly after the Mexican order, and one of the first hotels in the city, though, not by any means adapted to the ideas of Americans, being very similar to sketches Nos. 19. and 20. The suburbs of the city (which are very extensive) are almost entirely composed of miserable looking one story flat roof'd mud dwellings of a dilapidated appearance which are much inferior to  the [*34*]very lowest order of dwellings found in any part of the  States, and contrast in a very striking manner with the numerous splendid sanctuaries, public buildings, towers, domes, and superfluous grandeur of the interior city. None of our company even dreamed of the surprising splendours, which broke so suddenly upon them, when they entered the thronged plazas amid the thousands of vacant gazers who seem'd to view us as some unearthly intruders, just draft among them from some other plannet. Our ideas were never so much unhinged at when too closely crowded by dense throngs of starving Mexicans, who with wondrous eyes and  open mouths, Knew not in decency where to end their extravagant curiosity. As we entered the  streets were quick ly thronged, the windows and  iron gratings filled with Seniorettas or Ladies, the doors with wise heads and muchatcha's of boys with some upon the very house tops, to the  Americans enter into the precincts of their almost forbidden walls of China. An unfriendly feeling towards the Americans was soon evident from their language  as it was a day of religious ceremonies, and rest from labor, the church and plaza was thronged, by Mexicans dressed in their holliday best. We passed through this pleasant town, without halting and ascended a steep, high and rugged mountain at the immediate suburbs of the town. On looking back towards Amattitan, distant 14  miles to the South east and Tekelah at its base I hastily sketched the view as in No 59. On ascending this mountain I saw an animal of the Lizard Species about 2 feet in  length lying upon a large boulder rock in a ravine. After ascending we passed several miles through a  a deep, [and] very narrow, and crooked ravine among the highland hills; it was perfectly adapted to the purposes of Ladrones or Robbers, and has been recently the theatre of bloody deeds, robberies, &c. Here jet black Quartz began to appear plentiful after passing in single file for Several miles under the arches and bluffs of this wild and narrow ravine, we descended into a small and pretty valley, where there was a small farm, green fields and some water, from  this we ascended large hills, almost composed of  [*35*]the same brittle jet black quartz, before named. So much so, that it was hard upon the feet of our animals, we again descended into a gently sloping valley of about two miles in width, at the far northern end of which we could see the interesting Lake of Madalena, which I sketched on a nearer approach as in No 60. Showing the town of Madalena on the margin of the Lake, beyond which that welcome sheet of water with its interesting mountain scenery appeared, reminding one much of similar scenes in Italy and Switzerland; and rather unlike many other Mexican towns. At this place we stopped in a comfortable mason overnight, halting about 4 P.M. An opportunity offering I went and upon the margin of the lake and sketched view No 61 looking west among the mountains over which the sun was setting. Also No 62 looking south east towards part of the town Madalena is a town of a shady and pleasant appearance. Most of its streets are narrow and crooked, but well shaded in general. The plaza, was of good size and had a fine large antiquated church upon the south eastern side of it. Around which there was a large crowd of worshippers,uncivil manners, and in two of our party being stoned upon the city plaza; all of which we readily discovered and were particularly cautious, in being upon our guard, whilst we were frequently rendering civilities for incivilities. To these however we are happy to state that there were a number of exceptions, among the higher classes, and the better informed, which gave us a better opinion of Potosi, than we otherwise should  have had. We were nearly three days in this interesting city during which time whilst our guide was preparing fresh mustangs &c for our further journey to Mazatlan; and having some opportunities, I availed myself of them in visiting and sketching some of the massive and beautiful churches &c, having first obtained permission from an alcalde's clerk in the Governors' Palace, to visit and sketch as I wish'd. I proceeded in company with an American friend about 1 1/2 miles south from  the city, towards the Mosa Mountain, where from the remains of an old mud fort, I sketched the domes  &c of the city as in No 24. nearly all of which belong to magnificent churches erected many years past by the Spaniards at enormous costs, and decorated  in theinterior with gorgeous and the most exhorbitant displays of wealth and splendour that the human immagination could well conceive of, and far exceeding any thing of the kind to be found in the States. An open plane of more than a mile in extent each way extended between the fort and the city, upon which several hundred Mexican soldiers were exercising with targets, drilling &c. At this time large forces are concentrated here, who appear to be preparing for political struggles for power. To the right of this open plane, there are four parallel rows of the beautiful Alamo trees forming a shady and a very pleasant walk of about one mile from the city proper southward to the front  of the magnificent sanctuary (Santoario) as in fig 25. At each end and along this walk there are handsomely ornamented fountains. No 25 is a view of the Sanctuary and Mosa Mountains from the same position, where fig 24 was taken. A nearer view of the Sanctuary was then taken from the front near a fountain, as in fig 26, including two fountains two neat gardens, and the style of seats surrounding the principal fountain. The workmanship upon this magnificent edifice appears to be a contribution of the various orders ofArchitecture which in execution I believe to be superior to any thing similar which I have seen in the States. Not even excepting Trinity Church in New York, and composed of a hard red sand stone very similar to the one named. This church though over a mile from the city was under military guard, from whom I asked permission to enter but was told that the chief key of the Sanctuary was in the posession of the Captain, who was out drilling his  men upon the plane beforementioned. On returning to the city we passed a number of handsome edifices of  singular and antiquated appearance, but my opportunities limited me in sketching many of them. The streets were thronged in almost every direction, and should one attempt a sketch in their presence, a crowd of noisy gabbling superstitious men, women, and children, would soon compell a retreat, at the risk of being stoned, amid the jeers, and language suiting degraded and grossly ignorant minds. I was told there were over fifty handsome Sanctuaries or churches in this city, which from appearances I doo not doubt. None but the Catholic religion is tolerated here as in other parts of the Republic, and in passing each Sanctuary, even upon the opposite side of the street, the person is required to takeoff his hat, and retain it in his hand, until he has passed the door of the Sanctuary, otherwise he is liable to be stoned at the shortest notice; if nothing worse may happen him. I'm entering the church during service he is required to kneel, and to accompany respectfully in the ceremonies of the church. The interior splendors of these numerous churches, I could not describe in justice within my present compass. Their displays are gorgeous in the highest degree of man's ingenuity; and frequently exhibit much of the Theatrical; in some instances the walls and high gothic roof, being entirely covered with thousands of gothic (relief) devices, are entirely gilt with gold or silver leaf, until the whole interior glitters like a solid golden palace, with richly ornamental chandaliers, lights of various colors, hundreds of Statues of life size, adorned in robes of brilliant colors, gems, in great profusion, magnificent organs, select gallaries for the paintings, relicts, and statues of the saints, in one apartment of the St Domingo Sanctuary I was shown the bones of saints, and such other things as would fill a volume to describe.On returning to the main plaza, I sketched the Palace  of the governor as in fig 27. a crowd of noisy belligerents soon manifested a a jeering aspect, which compelled me  to finish my sketch rather hastily. I then passed off hastily until I had eluded the noisy crowd of  ignorammus's and by permission getting upon the  roof of a house. I sketched therefrom the beautiful  and very extensive Sanctuary of \"San Francisco\" as in  fig 28. showing its domes, cupolas, and spires as it appeared from the North east corner. Its bells  are numerous of many tones, and remarkably fine; the  interior like an immense museum, is crowded, with  wealth, and splendours beyond description. It has  as near as I can judge over, one thousand apartments,   a part of which are very elegant in their styles, guildings,  statues, paintings, stuccoed works, altars, tombs, vaults,  organs, galleries, painted domes, stained glass, chandeliers, massive gilt gothic works &c. &c. It covers a large  square, and is almost a royal city of itself. I after proceeded  to the Church and College of St. Josephs, which I  sketched as in No 29. My visits also extended to the magnificent  Sanctuary of St. Domingo, the front of which wasGuarded by a large mounted Cannon, and in a house, beside it several hundred soldiers. The interior of this great  church was the most gorgeous I ever beheld, its walls  and gothic ceiling was so gilt with gold leaf, as to appear  like one immense golden gothic palace. The Captain  of this division politely accompanied me through the  church, explaining its sacred relicts, &c. Among which  I saw immages of Angels, about 4 feet in height appearing to be cast of Gold, encased in splendid cases over  the grand Altar. A similar image of the Virgin  and Saviour sitting upon a throne of very massive  silver clouds, over which was an immense dome  inlaid with porcelain of rich colors. There was A large and  beautiful Organ upon a highly ornamented gallery, resting  upon Lions, that seemed watching the congregation,  And numerous saints in richest robes, (of nearly full  size) were to be seen in every direction. The interior  forum of the church was that of a cross, having two  magnificent Altars. I asked permission to sketch this  fine church from the little plaza front, but was  told that it could not be granted, without a  special permit. I then proceeded to sketch theyards, with numbered cells, in which from 10 to 30 may sleep on a brick pavement, having their own blankets of course. There is usually a cook shop in one of these cells, called a \"Fonda,\" where coffee, meat &c. are prepared to order, and usually well charged for; although the cooking may be very inferior to any thing in the States. In chocolate, however, the Mexicans excel, and sometimes in coffee, and especially in light sweet cakes. March  25th.  (Sunday)  Our company (of between 40 and 50,)  Left San Louis Potosi this morning at half past five, in double file presenting to the gazing crowds quite a military face, as red flannel was very conspicuous on almost every man, for almost every coat was off, it being clear moderately warm, and very dusty for a time. In the distance the city appeared beautiful and interesting. We soon entered upon open and barren rolling hills, where I found several handsome specimens of agate scattered among gravel. I neither heard of, or saw any of the silver mines of this State, though I believe them to exist in Durango, Zacatecas, and the state of San Louis Potosi, as large silver trains pass down to Tampico from this country, every few weeks. [*38A*]about 10 miles from San Louis, we entered upon some very rocky hills, into deep ravines, several narrow vallies and through narrow passes, with a cross here and there at short intervals, marking the spot where some traveller has been murdered, and his remains, if poor, deposited beneath. Our company was composed of over 40 American two Spanish guides, 8 Arrearos' or mule drivers, (Mexican) and 14 pack mules to carry our baggage allowing 150lbs. to each mule in order to travel with speed and safety. Our guns, pistols, swords, knives, &c. were all ready for immediate use, and were kept in excellent order, and many of our boys made the vallies echo with their jovial songs whilst passing, at the same time keeping an eye for any vagrant Guerrillas among the cliffs and brushes. One of the narrow vallies through which we passed during this day was peculiarly romantic, whilst a broad creek filling nearly the width of this valley of precipices, meandered with it; the bed of this creek, was in most places almost dry, so that we travelled some miles upon beds of gravel. At one place, on passing up the side of a precipitous, volcanic hill, I saw a very great quantity of handsome Geods of Calcedony, scatteredchief plaza looking eastward, including the fountain The Parroquia, a fine church, and a small part of   St Domingo east of it. A crowd of idle male and female spectators soon assembled around me bobbing continually their ugly phiz's directly in my face, so as interrupt, and intercept the view I was sketching -- presently two officers in military uniform, arrested me, and proceedded with me to an Alcalde's office, at the left base of the Governors' Palace. He wished to know  if I had a permit to sketch, I informed him that I had from the Praefectas' Clerk; upon which he discharged me and sent an officer (in uniform) to accompany me to my former seat on the Plaza, who stood by me with drawn sword, and like a gallant man kept men, women, and boys, at full bey, until I had finished my task, when he left me with a polite bow, &c. No 30, represents that sketch on the chief plaza. This plaza is almost always densely crowded by  all grades and classes of people, who stare as much as Americans, as though they were Bedouin Arabs; No 31. is a red sand stone fountain, which I sketched in the Southern port of the city at the head of the Allamo                                           walk before described.It is much of the time crowded by visitors for water, No 32. is the chief market plaza; upon this plaza are numerous Doric pillars, well finished from red sand rock, it is intended in time to place a roof upon them so as to shelter the market to be held therein. This view is looking north, at the present time the markets are held around the principal building. A good cup of coffee can be had here for a Mordeau 6 1/4 ct and mellons with many other things proportionably cheap. At this date 25th March, water mellons &c. are plentiful and cheap; the markets appeared flush with delicious fruits, oranges, mellons, cantelopes, bannannas, &c. etc; but no apples or peaches; no walnuts, chesnuts, or hickory nuts, yet similar though better than the market of Tampico. The scenery about San Louis Potosi is in places romantic and interesting when combined with the distant mountain scenery of the Southwest; the contrast of mud huts with splendid edifices and the superb residences of the wealthy are very striking and is the first thing to be observed by every traveller. At this place, they are decidedly hostile to theAmericans, partly I presume from the late war and in part from religious education. At evening the  Host, or priests, pass around in a fine carriage, drawn by mules; before which a number are seen walking, each carrying his candle, whilst several small bells, are tinkling to the heavy toll of deep tone'd bells of the Sanctuary every person male, female, young & old, must Kneel to  the host whilst passing This is a strict religious  ceremony, the nonobservance of which brings at once  upon the head of the disobedient immediate dangers  either in being stoned, or possibly something worse,  besides inculcating the ill will of the observers. In  San Louis, though there are English, French, and  some Americans, yet they are much more strict  in Religious observances than in Tampico, and  Americans should be more on their guard in  passing into the interior of Mexico and westward. As near as I could ascertain, the population of  San Louis Potosi, is about 75 thousand. The proportion of which are illitterate Mexicans of the Indian  race, called Mexican Indians. They are usually clothed  indifferently, live similar in mud huts, upon mud  floors, andlead a servile life, or one of complete indolence. Our Company remained 3 days in San Louis in order to purchase some fresh Animals, shoe others, and prepare for our further progress to Mazatlan. The two divisions with others joined in order to leave Potosi together, so as to make a display of arms, as we were informed that 70 armed guerrillas had preceeded us to the mountain passes in order to rob us, as it was currently reported here that we were in posession of a large amount of gold, and going to California to remain. It is well known that a large population of robbers live in San Louis Potosi, whose chief business is to watch and rob travellers, which makes robberies every day affairs in this country. The Mexican Indian population of this part of the Republic, seeing the monopolies of the government, have rebelled and endeavored to first down the present government with that pretext, and at the same time committing gross outrages and robberies under that cloak, by themselves. I am not aware of any Hotel in the American style existing in the whole city of San Louis, Masons or public houses exist there, which consists of squarefor at least a half mile upon the pass, No 33. is a hasty sketch taken offhand in passing a part of this interesting valley, having a large gravel bed in the foreground No 34. is a sketch of curious mountain looking west, from the summet of a gently sloping prairie hill, after having ascended from the narrow passes, and large hills on the east to this much more elevated country. In the afternoon we came upon an extensive open prairie with a gentle slope of miles, without timber and covered with parched grass, so that there was no shade, with an abundance of dust flying in considerable clouds. Several times during the day, Mexicans, richly dressed, and well mounted upon firey steeds, would ride into our ranks, bow politely, talk for a time, and then disappear, we judged them to be the guerrilla spies, and took good care to show them our determination and strength of arms. Just before sunset we arrived at the Hacienda of Tepetate, the proprietor being hostile to the Americans, would not permit us to occupy the Mason, so that we were compelled to camp out not withstanding the night proved to be very cold; we raised our camp fires, and soon prepared excellent though plain suppers, which took their usual round in messes. A strict guard was set, and the1849. March. night passed off without molestation, although anticipated before sunset I took sketch No 35 of Tepetate Hacienda. (Monday)  26th  Day clear and warm. Commenced March this morning at 6. O clock. The scenery ahead was extensive, pretty, and interesting. Several of our men were on the  sick list to day, but nothing very serious, except one man who had his arm broken some days back of San Louis Potosi, but he is now rapidly improving. Our journey today extended 18 leagues, the same as yesterday and one horse lost on this days' march, on every day event with the numerous trains on this route to Gaudalaxara. During the day we passed over a hilly country and  then upon a gently rolling country covered with immense fields of wild cactus, prickly pears, and other thorny plants usually from 5 to 10 feet in height, and often extending thus as far as the eye could reach, without any relief of other plants, &c. I found some pretty specimens of Chalcedony by the way. At evening we arrived at the Hacienda of Novelia, about 100 miles from Potosi. A pretty green valley was spread out on the right, and a similar valley to the left, whilst we descended upon the rocky side of the hill as inNo. 36 into the right hand valley facing the southwest, we camped again in front of a Mason, and they were still hostile towards us. At night a cloud dark as Egypt rol'd o'er us from the North West, with a short but heavy shower, accompanied with heavy thunder and lightning. Our baggage escaped by being carried under shelter, and we passed a very uncomfortable night. About eleven at night when darkness reigned in blackness, a noise like stampeeding or stealing  our horses and mules took place. 7 or 8 of our party immediately proceeded to search for the intruders with loaded arms, but found none there except our mule drivers; An hour after some alarm was created by hearing about 40, reports similar to the firing of guns in quick succession over in the next valley; we were however ready for any guerrillas or other intruders, but they did not trouble us further, as we fired salutes a number of times which echoed along the valley like sober precautions. [*Tuesday 27th*] Day clear and warm. Commenced our march at 6. O. clock, and crossed extensive open, dusty, and hot prarie plains. By eight in the morning the Sun generally gets warm and quite hot by nine, which continues until the customary evening breeze springs up from 12 to 5. O. clock.About noon we passed a romantic village where I sketched the church in No 37. but did not think to learn the name of the village as I was much in the rear when I drew it, besides being attacked by a noisy pack of wolfish dogs. To day we began to find plenty of palatable fruit upon the prickley pear plants that were very abundant on our way; which became more ripened as we advanced. We passed around the base of a lofty and barren rocky mountain into a magnificent valley, where could be seen many handsome Haciendos, ranches little lakes walled up, with strong stone breastwork, extensive fields under good cultivation, some of which were irigated by fresh running streams, woodlands, a small meandering river, orange-groves, and other marks of civilization, besides another long and very beautiful village, along a broad and shady road, very unlike what we had seen since leaving San Louis Potosi. It was really an extensive or far reaching valley of civilization handsome ranches, and a garden spot, among the barren praries and mountains of Central Mexico. Rabbits (with long ears and) of uncommon size, were very plentiful, 7 and 8 have been started at a time, of course we made some fine meals from them; A fine fresh breeze blows yet each afternoon from the Gulf of Mexico but in a few more days we are told that it will blow from the Pacific Ocean, towards the east each afternoon at the same time though opposite to that from the Gulf of Mexico. Before Sun set we landed at a rancho called \"San Nicholas\" a dilapidated rancho unlike much of this fine valley which I sketched as in Number 38. here some of our party were in to bathe, though the water was cold, being considerably elevated; water mellons, eggs, &c. were abundant and cheap, and the mellons of excellent quality. Notwithstanding we might here occupy rooms in a  Mason, yet most of our party preferred sleeping out in the open air, although it was somewhat cool at night. At this place there is a small church, which from the peculiarly rude paintings of Deer &c upon it, I would judge to be very ancient among modern things; it has however a flat roof, which is the customary Mexican fashion of building, except where they have become partially Americanized.Wedned. 28th. Day clear and warm. Commenced our march at 6. O. clock for a short days travel of only 15 miles to the beautiful city of San Maria Del Lagos, which is located down the same handsome and fertile valley as before described. Our road was broad, well setled, and abounded with shade, water, and pretty scenery, whilst we were most of the time in full view of the two opposite mountain ranges of barrenness on each side of this pleasant valley of groves and gardens. We entered Lagos city, over a small but handsome stone bridge, by a broad road, quite equal to some of our American McAdamized roads, and of very pretty and romantic scenery. We entered in double file with the pack mules ahead as usual, and presented quite a line of a military face, as each had his coat off, exhibiting uniformly red flannels, and plenty of well kept arms. Multitudes gazed upon us with apparently great surprise and curiosity, to which we have now become accostomed. After winding about for some time along the various streets, &c, we at last came to quarters in the \"Mason De Merce.\" Crowds soon surrounded our wide spreading archway,to sell us mellons, oranges, sweetmeats, etc. &c. In company  with a friend I visited the Market plaza, where I  purchased a fine cantelope for a Quartelia a 3 ct. piece,  a bowl of buttermilk for a Tolacco, 1 1/2 ct. piece. A good  water mellon for a Quartee, 3 cts. a box of excellent  preserves for a Tolacco, 1 cent and a half, and a good  bowl of coffee for a Madeau or 6 1/4 cts. This is the  only place where I ever saw Ice cream for sale. A number of delicious fruits crowded this market, that  we never see in the States, some of which we found  wild along our road. Near the Market there is a  fine large public plaza, well built up with stones  of the first class, with shade trees, many good seats,  and a handsome fountain in the centre. On the North  side of this plaza there stands one among the most  noble and massive Sanctuaries of Mexico, and usually  ranked among her chief churches, which I  endeavored to sketch as in No. 39. it is build of a hard  light red sand stone approaching a cream color; I did  not obtain its dimensions, but it is certainly larger than  any church which I have ever seen in the States, and  in workmanship equal to the finest church of New York.It rises in Lagos like an immense collosal pile, a great monument of perseverance and skill,. It has been erected about 40 years, and towers above the city like St Peters' at Rome. The interior is still more splendid than its exterior, gorgeous displays of wealth, immense gothic works in gold and  silver leaf, are suspended from the far off ceiling, an organ, richly decorated is supported by a beautiful and curiously formed gallery, Pilasters of great height trimmed with silver leaf, rise between and separate very large and brilliant paintings. Statues, here and there decorated with costly dresses, gems, &c occupy their several positions whilst the chief  Altar is a piece of work of great expense and  magnificense, [whilst] and a high arching dome throws its many color'd lights down upon the rich counter colors of the chief Altar, and gives to the whole a peculiarly beautiful appearance. Bells of great magnitude (originally from Spain) toll at various hours of the day in concert with the other church bells of the city. By permission I ascended the only tower in which the great bells are suspended, andfrom that massive stone cupola, I sketched scene No 40.  looking south west over a portion of that fertile  valley before described, and a part of the city of Lagos,  including several fine churches, and the nunnery &c, showing two important table mountains in the distance, the present bed of the river, which is now nearly dry, and the flat rooves of the city; with a small part of the public plaza. This is the most interesting section for a view out of four, as it comprehends only about 1/4th of the city, and time would not permit me to sketch any others in this interesting city. The delay of a half day at Lagos was occasioned by our horses and mules requiring some improvements in shoeing, thus affording me a short period for sketching. This town includes about 12 thousand inhabitants, and is apparently a thrifty and stirring place of considerable neatness and beauty, though in places antiquated. This afternoon at 2.O.clock, a party of 7 Americans and 5 Frenchmen arrived here from Verra Cruz, and the city of Mexico. They met with troubles and dangers by the way, and were very glad to join in with our company in going to Mazatlan, which a part of them did in dangerous times.[*Thorsd 29th*] Day clear and warm. Commenced our march this morning at 6.O.clock, for the beautiful city of \"San Juan Del Lagos,\" a place of about 7 thousand inhabitants, and about 12 leagues distant from the former. More than half the days march was over a dry and barren country. We approached within a very short distance of the town, before discovering it, as it was  situated in a narrow and very deep valley, and hardly discovered until we had got nearly over it, when we descended a paved road directly into the city of life, and dense crowds of curious spectators. The scenery of this deep and narrow valley, with its meandering  water course, and the distant mountains, was peculiarly  barren and wild; but the town had pleasant orange groves, gardens, &c, with shady walks and fountains here and there and a very handsome plaza, upon which  was the largest and finest Sanctuary we had yet seen even surpassing in magnitude the one last seen,  this was indeed a stupendeous pile of human art and perseverance; a sign informed us that its age exceeded 100, years, and it was yet in an excellent state of preservation. In front of this grand Sanctuary therewas a handsome fountain in the centre of a public plaza, surrounded by seats and in a circle of small Allamo trees. Most of the houses were highly ornamented with various colored devices, whilst rows of massive collonades, made the plaza scene quite agreeable, which was very much crowded by the inhabitants, and the market plaza was in its immediate vicinity. No. 41 is a sketch of the grand Sanctuary of \"San Juan Del Lagos.\" in magnitude and external beauty it exceeds the other at San Maria  Del Lagos, but in its interior magnificense it is about the same though still more expansive. The floor of the interior is inlaid with porcelain of China of various colors of chequered work; and the same upon the outer surface of the great dome. The workmanship of the steeples (which are very high) is considered inferior to none in all Mexico, certainly I never before saw any similar work equal to them, either in Mexico, Canada or the States. Time would scarcely permit a careful sketch of this massive edifice, and night closed upon me without my being able to get others from other positions, of fountains, churches, and a view of the city &c. As our party left early next morning no time of course was available for further sketches.[*Fridy. 30th*] Day clear and warm, Commenced our march at half past six O.clock, crossing a large and costly stone bridge, the handsomest and largest I had yet seen in Mexico; it was handsome and built entirely of a light hard free stone; toll was paid in crossing it. a paved road wound around and up the hill in a serpentine form until it reached the summet, from which there was a splendid view of the town, river, churches, groves, &c; we passed from this pleasant view into another very steep, deep, and narrow valley; from which we arose again to follow a rolling barren country of prarie hills, covered here and there with fragments of loose broken rocks, and much broken chalcedony. An Alcalde with Lady, &c. has accompanied our train for several days, keeping near us, and travelling in a regular Mexican carriage drawn by 6 mules, four of which travel abreast, with a driver sitting upon one of them, the whole affair appeared clumsy. He usually stopped at the same Masons with our company; he was evidently travelling under our  protection from Ladrones or robbers, as the Mail and several Mexican gentlemen were then dooing.about 9.O. clock this morning a body of 3 or 4 hundred Mexican soldiers passed us, followed by many women and children, the whole of whoom were on foot except their officers. At the head of one of their companies was an Irish Deserter who addressed us in the usual language of contempt whilst a number of the soldiers spoke to us in Spanish and a little in the English. They were bound for Rio Verdy, a town of importance towards Tampico, in order to put down Queros and his party, who were opposed to the Government of Herrara. During the after part of this day we passed over an extensive country of open rolling and barren praries, exhibiting scarcely any thing else but rocks, gullies, parched grass and in places an abundance of dust. At evening we landed at an old dilapidated rancho, where provisions were scarce and dear; the name of this rancho was \"Lavent,\" which I sketched and No 42, at sunset. [*Sat. 31st*] Day clear and warm. Commenced our march this morning at half past six O. clock, having only 7 leagues for the day For the first time, we now passed through a valley of gentle undulations, having a very red soil, that  was under cultivation, and appearing to be productive, along the valley there was about a half mile to the right,a high hill appearing very much like an old dilapidated pyramid, which was the opinion of several who saw it. During this mornings march, we passed through several small villages of scattering mud cabins, inhabited as usual by Mexican Indians. About 1.O.clock we descended a paved road into a broad ravine, and after crossing a bridge ascended upon the side of a low spreading hill into the town of Tepatillan, where we remained until the following morning as it was too far to the next rancho for the day. Before night [nigh], I sketched the church as in No. 43. the age of which is nearly a century and a half. It is a plain building, very large, and of an Antiquated appearance. This town contains about 6 thousand inhabitants; having a neat and pleasant appearance about the plaza, and chief streets. The walks of the plaza are all followed by ranges of very large and spreading shade trees resembling the Oak though more expansive. In the centre of this plaza there is a handsome fountain, and on the South Side of it, the town market, and opposite under a long colonade where the Alcalde's office was located. A young man from the States, was arrested [here] by some Frenchmen andimprisoned here on a charge of stealing two hundred  dollars, which he protested against strongly. Most of  our company visited him, and by much taking with  the Alcalde had him taken from a miserable cell  of crowded polution, and placed in better quarters,  we could not get him released, and had to leave him  at the mercy of his enraged enemies, and the Alcalde  believing him to be innocent of that charge, although  he frankly acknowledged having stolen 60 dollars  in Mexico, whilst in distress. Upon which acknowledgement  the Alcalde made out his commitment. The  Frenchmen (we were afterward told.) Said they would  wait until the Americans had left, when by some  means they would get him out, and kill him in the  mountains. The whole appeared like a sad affair. I felt sorry for the young man for we could not  render him assistance without endangering our own  liberty. The feelings of the whole American Company  were against the Frenchmen, who treated him with  severe abuse. He was a delicate young man of about 20.  and said that he had left a widow'd mother and a  sister in the States, and he pointed to a ring on hisfinger, and said that this was the only token of theirs now in his possession, and that at night in his cell, the Mexicans had wrench'd his finger repeatedly to get it. If he escapes, it will be by some miracle unknown to wiley Frenchmen, and stupid Mexicans. This evening the host passed around the plaza drawn in his superb carriage, with the usual ceremonies. April Sund 1st Day clear and warm. Commenced our march at an early hour. The first part of the day we passed over a rolling and barren woodless country, with mountains in the distance. In the afternoon we descended into a lower country a large valley extending many miles and somewhat of a triangular  form as in No 44. In this valley a stream meandered along which in places woodlands appeared. At one place on a low and spreading hill, beside this stream, was located a very romantic and beautiful little town, the admiration of all our company. It appeared to be one forest of very tall orange trees, with bushels beside bushels laying thickly strewn upon the ground in almost every direction with small and neat cabins scattered here and there through these extensive groves. Most of the orange trees  were over 20 feet in height, much resembling largeapple orchards. Among the rest of the pleasant things to be observed here, was a cool and refreshing mountain spring of considerable size rushing rapidly in various branches down the quick descents of several of its streets. Shaded by palms, cactus, orange groves and shrubbery, We passed in sight of the plaza; where I saw a neat looking church. About 4 or 5 miles from this village we passed through another, less shaded, beside the same stream, and near a fair looking stone bridge. Still continuing in this long valley, just before sunset, we came to a river of good size, and descending a long slope lined on either side with Mexican cabins, from a  large mason on the hill, down upon a very large and antiquated stone bridge, upon which were four square towers, upon two of which were statues of the King and Queen of Spain, with an inscription beneath nearly obliterated by time, upon the other two towers were statues of monks or fathers. we crossed this large bridge and put up at a mason on the opposite side in the little town of Tolololotlan, after passing up a street of cabins of more than a mile in length, we found our Mason. I then proceeded in company down to thebeautiful banks of the Rio Grande or San Antonio, and sketched  the great bridge as in No 45, looking north from  above on the west bank of this interesting stream. On the opposite or North side of the bridge of  Tolololotlan, the whole river pitches over large  masses of rocky boulders with a heavy lumbering  roar that can be heard for several miles before  reaching it; above it spreads out to a considerable  width dotted here and there promiscuously with  small and interesting islands, with green meadows  rolling hills, and the lofty blue mountains, all of which  forms a highly picturesque scene, which I endeavored  to sketch as in No 46. On first beholding this fine  little river, it may naturally be supposed that we  rejoiced at the first sight of a stream that emptied  into the great Pacific Ocean, and it seem'd to make  us feel that a part of our great journey to California  via Mexico would soon draw the land chapters  to a grateful close. On the following morning by early light  I sketched a part of the interior of our Mason as in sketch 47.  where the earthen flower jars were plentifully ranged  around the tops of our mason columns, containing  shrubs &c.1849. April. At this place we fell in company with a small New York party  of 8 or 10 persons, and learned from them, that one of  their party had been shot in the head by accident and  killed instantly, it happened at a bridge not far from this  place; the father of the deceased was present in the same company. Mond 2nd Day clear and warm. Commenced our march at 6.O.clock for 8 leagues. Passed through a small cove, and then upon a high plane  where there was a considerable pond or small lake, and  afterwards crossed a deep ravine upon a stone bridge by a  small village, a place noted for robberies &c. and from thence  proceeded over a hilly and picturesque prarie country until  we ascended a considerable ridge, in company with a very  large burthen train of miles for the great city just ahead. On descending this slope into a somewhat lower country  a distant view of Gaudalaxhara, broke upon us as in  sketch 47. which I hastily copied by the way, being then  within about 6 miles of the city and looking North west. Before arriving at Gaudalaxhara, at 4 miles distant, we  passed through a small town of a very pleasant appearance  in which there was the remains of a once superb sanctuary. A handsome shaded plaza with a curious fountain,  and a tall and handsome dragon fountain at the North west  suburbs of the town,on this plaza sweet meats, lemonade, and other  mild drinks with Polka, a drink sweeter than cider, with oranges, mellons, bannannas, and other fruits were very abundant and cheap. the exhibition of which presented quite a pretty appearance as they were promiscuously ranged about the fountain plaza beneath the broad spreading shade trees. From the suburbs of this town to the suburbs of Gaudalaxhora, there is a broad Mc Adamized road 3 miles in length, with 4 rows of spreading shade trees, principally of the Allamo with others of very great magnitude, as in sketch  No 48. extending its whole length, thus dividing two pleasant and shady walks on both sides of the principal road, which was about 50 feet in width, about 100 feet including each walk, this road with its neighboring scenery and a distant inkling of the city presented quite a pretty and interesting appearance. We entered the city in double file, with pack mules in the advance. The suburbs appeared very extensive, and it was at least one hour before we reached our Mason, as we seem'dGaudalaxhara. continually winding hither and thither, among a continuous crowd of strange brown faces and peculiar scenes. Having arrived in one of the handsomest and greatest cities of all Mexico, I hastened to avail myself of every opportunity to explore and discover its fine arts &c. In entering we passed 4 or 5 very handsome public edifices but time would not permit me to sketch them except in a  general view. an aqueduct of water, at first mistaken for a regular canal with stone bridges, abutments and its handsomely finished breast works crosses the southern part of the city proper, along it there are shady walks of trees great Magnitude and age, with fountains in shady places,  and fruit plazas in various directions; watermellons were vastly abundant, and cheap, piles of them were seen on almost every little plaza, where any fruit might be sold. As near as I could ascertain the population of Gaudalaxhara, was about One hundred and seventy five thousand which I believe is about the correct estimate, as it appears much larger than Baltimore, M.D. April. Tuesd 3rd Day warm & clear. Our company concluded to remain in this fine city over this day to proceed early on the morrow. Of course I saw and sketched as much as possible. [*31*]The city is very regularly laid out in right angle streets, usually from 20 to 40 feet in width public gardens and several fine plazas, besides market squares variously. It is considered more than twice as large as San Louis Potosi, and the most beautiful of all the cities of this Republic, and second only to the city of Mexico in size. It is located in an interesting valley, and surrounded by barren mountains in the distance, and elevated several thousand feet above the level of the Ocean. A part of the valley about it is under very good cultivation and presents an extensive and civilized appearance. Every thing combined with a pleasant breezy afternoon, such as we had on entering Gaualaxhara, - a prettier scene could scarcely be found in any of the Northern States of Mexico. It is much admired and spoken of by all travelers who have visited it. Its communications with other towns is conducted entirely by mules, and horses, and all goods carried upon the pack saddles of mules. So that the main roads leading each way from the city, is almost constantly crowded for miles beyond the reach of the eye, with thousands of horsemen, and pack mules, going and returning in large companies.Near this city such scenes are really so animating that it would seem almost incredible were the number at one single view given. Dust is of course very plentiful During this day I visited many parts of the city, the interior of several splendid churches, public buildings, gardens, cemetaries &c. The main plaza, is the most splendid of all that I have yet seen in (all of) Mexico, and said to be handsomer than that of the city of Mexico. It is in the form of a square, followed by Allamo shade trees upon each side, with neat seats, and a handsome fountain in the center. The buildings which surround it are of the first class, and bear much resemblance to all the old Spanish edifices of Spain. The streets which Surround it, for nearly a mile in every direction, exhibit great displays of wealth, fashion, business, and refinement. There is a custom much used here, of covering the pavements with long and massive collonades of one and occasionally two stories in height. Almost every house, building, or edifice, excepting the finest sanctuaries, have the usual flat rooves, and generally a very massive appearance, somewhat similar to Egyptian customs. [*52*]Here strange scenes and strange brown faces, that - densely throng the plazas, markets, groves, [and] fountains, and beneath the long and massive colonnades, makes the American feel at once his absence from home, and his isolated position among the most strange of foreign countries. Strange customs, ceremonies, dress, and modes of living seems to transplanted you at once into another and different world. Go where you will, you are a stranger, and a strange object of gaping curiosity, even to the Soldiers in the Official Pallaces, who would treat you respectfully with small presents of fruits, and politeness, and permit you to intrude on forbidden ground, whilst a common mexican for the same intrusion without a permit, might find a sharp whack upon his callabash the consequence. Among the litterati and official circles of this city there is certainly less hostility to the Americans, than among the illitterate, half Indian, and Servile population, and those on the way back to San Louis Potosi. On the main plaza, there stands an immense Sanctuary of great dimensions and magnificense: It occupies asquare of itself including a grand wing called the Cathedral, as in No. 49. The chief building under the larger dome being called the Sagrario, all of which is now being repaired and repainted with superb interior displays. It is the grand Sanctuary of this city and among its finest buildings for interior displays, which are immensely grand and very elegant; gems, Saints in splendid attire, magnificent Altars, Organs, paintings, large immages apparently cast in gold, over the Altars, inlaid porcelain, work, stained glass of various  colors, beautiful silken draperies, massive silver ornaments, gothic columns, and gothic domes gilt with gold and silver leaf, until the whole glittered by the evening lights like some fabulous golden palace for beings above the common things of mortality. No such scenes of granduer can yet be found in the States, and I have been repeatedly surprised at the enormous wealth, which must have been lavished upon these religious pallaces in Mexico. judging from the time, and immense labor required in their completion; and in their superior pieces of Sculpture, Architecture, and paintings, with their mammoth bells, and [*53*]fine toned Organs, superior castings, elegant designs, drapery, massive granduer, orders of Architecture, and fine materials, which at this day, far exceeds the small and half civilized capacities of the original Mexican inhabitants. From Spain all this display of wealth, &c has originated, been cast, planed, carved, painted, and then transplanted upon the planes, vallies, and mountains of Mexico, and there set up profusely all over the land in immense colosal monuments, whilst Mexico was under that Government. From this beautiful plaza I proceeded towards the aquaduct Southward, where getting upon the flat top of a Mexican Mason or public house, I sketched scene No 50. looking North East, towards some of the mountain ranges, and over the prettiest part of Gaudalaxhara, which I selected from the four views, showing a part of the aquaduct a fine large church, a part of the Hospital in the distance and a fine long park. The principal part of the city rises upon a broad and gentle undulation to the left of this aqueduct, the face of which is dotted here and there with handsomepublic edifices as in this view (No. 50). I then  proceeded to a fine public garden about a mile  from this location, in which I took sketch No. 51. I suppose that it covered about 8 acres, being larger  than any of the squares of Philada. In the centre  of it there was a large fountain, from which fine  walks passed off in each direction. Shade trees  of great magnitude covered the square, whilst the beds were full of beautiful shrubs in full  bloom, which on entering presented to us the appearance of a beautiful shady grove richly and  closely carpeted with many species of flowers  so ingeniously interwoven as to show the  figgure of one large flower by the shades of  those planted together. This I have seen  in many places through Mexico. In this garden  there was a fine large revolving swing with 4 seats,  similar to those in the States. This was a large and  very beautiful garden and appeared to be a place of fashionable  resort. From this place I proceeded towards  the aqueduct and sketched a curious fountain in  the long park as in No. 52. From this fountain [*54*]I proceeded about two miles to the northern suburbs,  and passing several beautiful churches of curious  Architecture, I came to a large enclosed Square, which  proved to be a cemetery; apparently of recent origin.  in the center of this square [was] I sketched No 53.  which is a handsomely ornamented and chequered frame with two interior apportuents which were  beautifully ornamented and richly decorated within  No 54 is a sketch of a beautiful freestone monument in the same enclosure. Directly facing No 53, and at  the opposite end of the same pavement I sketched  the grand collonade building as in No 55. each of those  square chambers along it are intended for two or more  coffins, the door of which being closed has upon the outer side the usual inscription of the tombstone. Day light prevented further sketches , though I would have taken many more if the opportunities would have  permitted. The market plazas were located in  several parts of the city, and were crowded to  excess with watermelons and other fruits. and on  one plaza exceeding any thing I had ever seen in  Mexico, and a most beautiful sight too, as everythingwas very tastefully arranged, even to the different colors of Lemonades, &c. Many fruits were abundant here that are never seen in the States.  most of which are sold at reasonable prices. After leaving the cold winter of the States and comming so suddenly into hot weather, dust, mellons, and oceans of fruit amid a Summer heat in Mexico  you may well suppose that we are quite sensible of this change; whilst we often remarked to each other, that our relatives at home little thought that we were now feasting upon the  finest mellons in the world, whilst the cold winds of winter were whistling around their homes. I doo not think that there are more churches here than in San Louis Potosi, notwithstanding this is so much longer than the former city of Potosi. I visited several fine churches, but had no  time to sketch even a small part of the great beauties I saw during even this one day. Though vehicles of any kind were seldom seen through  the country, yet heavy carriages of a clumsey - [*55*]   appearance for the aristocracy and the Priests were quite plentifull in townThe americans still continue to arrive in this city, 40 more during this day from Mexico. Wed 4th. Day clear and warm. Commenced our march at 6.O. clock. On leaving the city, we passed the walls of an extensive prison, which was being erected of stone, at the North Western suburbs. The road was broad, very much crowded, and almost one continued cloud of dust for many miles out of the city. About four miles on the way we passed a neat little village, with a magnificent Sanctuary or public edifice, therein of enormous dimensions and square walls enclosing some 8 or 10 acres, with very high (18 or 20 feet) iron railing in front which was ornamented and gilt, and ranging a full square between delicate pillars and light arches of stone. Some of our party supposed that it was the Bishop's Palace. About 12 miles from the city we passed a tall gate; it was a high stone gate crossing the road in one arch about 35 feet in height with a large Mason, and a few scattering huts about it. After this our road wound aroud large hills, deep ravines, through several narrow passes, and for the first time in a great distance, among numerous large pines, oak bushes, &c ranging over desolate looking hills.At about 20 miles from Gaudalaxhara, I made a hasty sketch  looking west as in No 56. showing the mountains and a small part of the lower valley country, which is somewhat below  the valley of the city we have just left. This is a celebrated  part of the country for Robberies, and we were even told in Gaudlaxhara, that two hundred, Ladrones or  Robbers had left that city the night before us, on our way  to cut us off at about 30 miles out. We did not however regard it, knowing the veracity of Mexican reports  which generally had some other crafty object in view. At about 22. or 23 miles from the city, we came upon an open prarie of rolling or undulating knolls, a part of which had them been recently burned off, on this black charry and dismal looking place, there stood  a large and high gallows, upon which were suspended  the bodies of three Robber chiefs; they had been suspended  there about 3 weeks, and were ghastly looking objects, bullet holes preforated their dried bodies in many  places which were nearly ready to drop to the earth.  over them was a large painted Sign, as follows -  \"Thus the Law punishes the Robber and the Assassin\". Only a few weeks before we arrived here these men [*56*]were chief actors in some bloody deeds, about this place, until some of the government troops overtook them with the justice they merited. The number of these Robbers are said to have been about 200 strong, committing  constant depridations and murders upon travellers and many of the regular Mexican baggage trains. This scene was to melancholy a picture to sketch, so that I left it for a more fit object and about 3. miles further west, as in sketch No 57. I copied a peculiar mountain and small village, to the right of which our road continued its torturous course. In the afternoon as we descended into a third interesting valley, our mountain scenery became extensive, very lofty, and peculiarly wild, moreso than we had yet seen them. Upon the right and upon the left were seen towering mountains, with immense barren cliffs above cliffs, and their numerous rugged woodless spears rising high in the air like collosal ruins of pyramids of yet untold of magnitude. To the west this great triangular valley tapered to our interesting focus, at the far point of which the sun was setting amid a few light and beautiful clouds.whilst the mountains diminished gradually as they receded in the background, all of which formed quite an intersting and beautiful landscape view though very wild. We then descended a hill into the lower valley, and took quarters for the night in a mason, beside the church on the market plaza of the town of Amattitan, being about 40 miles from Gaudalaxhara. Before dark I ascended a high precipice of rocks east of the market plaza, and sketched No 58. showing the square, the big walled spring facing the market, part of the church, part of the town of Amattitan, with its shade trees, with a part of the valley, and the mountains on the western horizon. Here we found plenty of mellons and other fruits all which were quite cheap. Our company here numbered over fifty. A part of them sat by moonlight under the broad archway of the gate of our mason, until 9. O. clock singing in concert, the national songs of America, some 60 or 70 Mexicans, crowded around them seemingly much delighted. About 9.O. clock a Mexican having stolen a purse, from Mr Hassan, was persued and shot at by him, which scattered the rest in short metre.The Alcalde, called next morning and commeded Mr Hassans' course, by saying that he wished Mr H. had killed the thief; it appears that he was wounded, but got off with the bead purse. We were informed at Gaudalaxhara, that this town was, and had been a celebrated rendezvous for the mountain Robbers. &c. [*Thurs'd. 5th*] Day warm and clear. Left Amattitan by early sun rise, and continued our march North west across the valley, among rolling hills of gentle slopes, having small rancho's here and there at short periods; this days road was peculiarly interesting in its scenery we saw to day many fields of the maguay plant ranging over many gentle hills, and upon some of the few fertile spots along the wild mountains base. They make a mild drink from it called  Polka, also the Ardiente, which is stronger than  whiskey, which I believe is made from the magauy also. About 11.O. clock A.M. we passed through Tekelah a town of some importance, noting perhaps 4000 inhabitants. It had a fine shady plaza, upon which stood a very large and antiquated church. On the plaza, fruit appeared in great abundance, andgoing through their usual ceremonies. fruits were abundant and 18, oranges were  bought here for a Madeau or 6 1/4 cts. Orange groves compose the  chief shade of the town. Several very large springs or rather small creeks, breakout of the hills east of the town square, and meander in rapid streams through several of the streets. The water was of a slightly milky cast, and an unpalatable limestone taste. At night the moon rose full and clear, with an occasional flitting cloud, and a gentle breeze. This night a band of 40 Mexicans, all [each] well armed with muskets, pistols, swords, and knives; - presented themselves in double file at the gate of our Mason, or Hotel; and demanded quarters there for the night. Our landlord believing them to be robbers told us to prepare our arms for service, which we did in a few minutes. The Landlord then told them through their captain, that his apartments were all full, and that they could not have quarters in his Mason, to which their captain answered that they would come in in defiance of him and those within. The gate of the Mason which was very broad, and of one expansive arch; the doors of which being open, the Robbers drew themselves up in a compact body immediately before it on the pavement and street. Our landlord stepping forward told them that they must wait a short time until he could see further about his accomodations. But he immediately passed out by another way from his Mason, in pursuit of the Alcalde of the town, who in a short time came with him to our quarters. The Alcalde enquired of their captain who they were, where from be. They answered that they were government soldiers; He then demanded of their captain, their passport as government soldiers, - but they could show none besides the said company acknowledged having travelled on two days, which by the laws of Mexico, no government troops, are permitted to travel. By their dress superabundance of arms, and statements the Alcalde judged them to be a band of ladrones or Robbers, following us, and not improbable that they were a detachment of a larger body, sent in town as government troops, in order to stop overnight in the walls of our Hotel to take us by surpriseand most probably after stealing our arms, then to attack the town, which is a common occurrence in many parts of Mexico. The Alcalde told us that he believed them to be Robbers. He evidently feared them. He told us to see that our arms were all in order and ready for execution in case we were attacked. Its a matter of course all our men were prompt in self defence, and with our guns, pistols, and knives, in hand and about us, we drew up in order, compactly before the door, facing the Robbers, who stood quietly facing and viewing us as mute as a posse of terrified owls; the Alcalde and our landlord refused them admittance into our Mason, but they would have entered by force had not our company presented a bolder front, headed by Capt Grant, of Philadelphia; who told them that they should not enter, except at the peril of their lives, at the same time every trigger was ready to tell. A moment of suspense, and they decamped in quick step up to the town plaxa, where they were permitted to stay by the authorities. After this the Alcalde came several times to ourquarters, telling us to put on extra guards, which we did, even upon the high walls, in order to stand sentinel over our horses as well as our other property, and persons. The Alcalde told us that there was a probability of either our company or the town being attack'd during the night, and wished us to promise that in case the town was attack'd by them, to assist the citizens and his little military force in putting down the Robbers, which we promised, and on the other hand he told us that if the attack should be directed first towards us, his people should assist us, but that we must not mistake and fire upon a religious procession of the citizens which would pass our Mason about 3 O. clock in the morning. This was an evening long to be remembered from many circumstances. It was a most beautiful moonlight night, and now and then a gentle breeze played fitfully from the beautiful lake of Madalena; My turn among the sentinels came from 12 to 2 O clock in the morning; and my positions around the high walls, and the expansive enclosed yards, was pleasant and romantic during so pleasant a night as this; seeming at times like a dream, that I were facing therounds of some ancient castle and looking down among the  dark shades of the groves around slumbering in silence beneath the full and magic moon. I stood upon the house top, meditating upon the beautiful Lake of Madalena, the mountains, standing off in deep shadows, the many flat rooves, the groves and the rocky cliffs near the town; about 2. O. clock a procession of the citizens took place; proceeding from the church and passed our Mason. It was headed by richly robed priests, who were chanting solemn airs; a full sized wax figure of our Savior, of full size, clothed in mourning with a crown of thorns, representing Him as passing up to Mount Calvary, whilst before Him were carried several hundred candles, with several hundred Mexican ladies following each with candles, accompanied with an excellent band of music, the whole was a peculiar scene. Before day light those Ladrones or Robbers before named had all disappeared, having preceeded us on our road through a formidable mountain and vastly grand ravine country, of deep cavernous valleys, suiting such a class of beings.1849 April 6th bay warm and clear. Commenced our march at  half past six o clock, winding our way around that beautiful and interesting lake of Madalena. Formidable mountains appeared in full view and an immense country of sugar loaf hills, sharp peaks, several hundred of which might be seen at one view from elevated positions, at times we passed over a graded road, upon which considerable pains had been taken, about 10 A.M. we descended into a very deep and curious valley of about two miles in width, passing down which it spread out to higher rolling hills with very deep chasms for water passing around these hills and amongst them variously. About 12  meridian I sketched Scene No 63 which was a large Hacienda, westward appeared very large mountains, between which and the Hacienda one several tortuous ravines, the deepest and most awfully grand that I ever saw, being more like immense caverns than ravines. through which we passed about 15 miles. They are called the \"Baranca's\". a road descends upon the  almost perpendicular face of one of them, which is very tortuous and romantic; as you might see the train quite beneath us.winding their way far down the deep cavernous  valley of the Baranca's; as in No 64. with high and  barren Mountains, sparcely timbered towering far above  these numerous deep Barancas. Passing along these  deep narrow vallies, we crossed several times a rapid  creek of some magnitude, over which in many places  high brown rocky cliffs, and various timbers,  bend gracefully over its romatic and noisy waters. No 65. is a sketch passing down the creek in this valley. No 66. do a short distance north west of the former sketch,   with high frowning bluffs of brown rocks. No 67. is another  passing father down the stream, where the road ascends  and again descends to the creek; after fording which  upon rocks [upon] from which the water was bounding  away rapidly; we ascended upon the opposite side,  where a small race of water descended to a pleasant  little dwelling, about which fine timber, several  species of very high cactus, and underbrush with luxuriant  grass were seen forming a highly picturesque  and romantic view. But our train passed so rapidly  that I was much in the rear with my last sketches,  and had to omit this pretty scene for one whichfollowed shortly after as in sketch no 68 where we came to  the junction of apparently three triangular vallies, or deep passes of the Barancas, and the junction of the two fine streams of fair water. At this place there was a pleasant Rancho over the creek, with little groves of oaks, pines, cactus, Bannannas, and beautiful green meadows. Our train turned round and up the left hand valley. And presently  came to scene as in No 69, very high, barren, and steep mountains of almost no timber, arose high in the air, with slight misty clouds around their summets; upon the side of one of them a road was seen ascending which is a view of a part of a graded road, cut over this great mountain by some foreigners at an immense cost, and in most places blown through the solid rock, and of excellent workmanship. In this little valley there was a mill of some kind in operation with a large horizontal wheel. I was afterwards told for the purpose of washing out the silver ore beneath the road, seen on the mountainside, there is a small and pleasant village, in which there is an abundance of fine fruits and surrounded by extensive green fields, meadows, groves, and fine timbers along the stream that meanders through its valley, that spreads  out to a ---triangular cove, dotted with several pleasant Rancho's, No 70. is a sketch taken on entering this pleasant cove where the village was located. After leaving the village we commenced ascending the mountain road. Time would not permit me to sketch as much as I desired, No 71. shows the workmanship on our fine road over, one of the most formidable mountains in Mexico, it is cut out of the rocks, and walled paved and graded thus all the way up this mountain for a distance of six miles. and as great a piece of work of its kind, as any that I know of in the U States of America. No 72. is another sketch farther up this fine road. The view from the Summet of this mountain looking eastward was fine indeed; including many a green and beautiful valley and more mountains, peaks, knolls, hills, vallies, dales, coves, and verdant spots, blended with wildness and prarie hills, than I had ever yet seen in all Mexico; and was really grand beyond description. The mountains far east about Gaudalaxhara could be seen like smoky shadows of deep blue mist. It is said that we have ascended to day, more than  7000 feet, above the deep Barancas through whichwe have just passed; and still a peak arises to our right, around which we wound our tortuous way looking over walls, that looked straight down upon abyss's that were quite beneath us thousands of feet. I found enough here for days of sketching, over which we passed rapidly as it was a region said to be well filled with Robbers, and frequent to many scenes of bloodshed, robbery, and other vile deeds; a few desperate men in these wild mountain passes could doo much harm even to a  large party. On the summit there is a rude breastwork evidently thrown up for that purpose. Cliffs of huge brown rocks here hang over frightful debths and thousands of deep ravines cut deep into and down the rugged mountain. This is our highest elevation  in crossing Mexico, we have gradually ascended 7000 feet to the Barancas, and about 7000 feet again to the summet of this grand dividing ridge of Mexico, making in all an elevation of about 14000 feet above the levil of the Sea. Upon this height we now have the afternoon winds from the Pacific Ocean; and from this forward to the Pacific each day, blowing uniformly from the west, and sometimes very strongly.We now commence our gradual descent toward the Pacific Ocean, an event of some interest to us of course; leaving the scenes east of the great Cordilleres, for those descending gradually into the mild and fertile vallies on the  great western side of this distinguished mountain. No 73. is a sketch of the first scene descending into  a beautiful and fertile valley, along which are plenty of Ranchos, several small villages, several sugar  mills, fine farms, meadows, groves, and plenty of small Mexican dwellings, shaded by Bannanas, Plantains, or perhaps the Allamo, or at times the spreading oak. A pleasant stream of water meandered along this  valley, the margin of which was thickly interwoven with brushwood, wildflowers, and followed by pleasant green meadows, which contrasted in a striking manner with the shadeless, and wild barren mountains; that were broken and rudely tossed into the high air as the fierce storms would toss the waters of the mighty ocean; and as rudely wild, and void of vegetation or timber in many places. This day we have made a march of 54 miles, and arrived at our Mason in the town of [Eastlan ?] a hour after sun set. It appeared to be a fine largetown; at sun set I sketched Eastlan at a distance of a few miles to the  east, being in advance of a part of our train, which during this day got much scattered on the way. There was a fine large Church in this town, with a large shaded plaza or public square, upon which there was a grand display of many  kinds of fruits, drinks &c. including watermellons, Oranges, Bannanas, &c. &c. with Lemonade; Polka, etc. A grand procession of the virgin Mary took place, this evening parading in large crowds the various streets of the town with hundreds of Ladies and Gentlemen each in procession, carrying their separate candles. The immage of the Virgin, was of full size, richly dressed in dark silks, and carried in a handsome Sedan; Other processions took place during  the evening; but I did not see all of them. This is a beautiful town of several thousand inhabitants; the houses are improving, are much neater, larger, and the people becoming much more refined and civilized than many of those before passed; Western Mexico, is well known to be the most refined and civilized portion of that country. We were much pleased with the decided improvement of whitewashing and other displays of taste in this place.No 74. is a hasty sketch of Eastlan and its surrounding mountains. The valley in which it is situated, descends gradually westward towards the Pacific Ocean; and is under good cultivation with pleasant Ranchos', several small villages &c. [*April 7th*] Day warm and clear; with an afternoon breeze from the  Pacific. Commenced our march at sun rise; and proceeded along the meanderings of a pleasant creek; that traversed this interesting valley. A few miles west of Eastlan we passed through a town of considerable size, within which there was a handsome shaded plaza, with a large, curious, and antiquated church. This town was also much shaded by Bannana and Orange groves and a greater part of the houses were very genteel. Here some of our company obtained excellent cups of chocolate &c. Many kinds of fruit were likewise abundant in this place. By the way, as we have before frequently seen, were erected several small shrines of some 8 or 10 feet square, in each of which was suspended the  cross, and around which were wreaths of roses, natural and artificial, with candles partly burned, and other things belonging to their religious ceremonies. These with lone cross's are to be seen plentifully throughoutMexico, and either mark a place of worship, or the spot where some individual has [been] met with an untimely  end. Proceeding down this pleasant valley and winding around various spurs of the wild mountains, that  rear'd their rugged heads upon either side of us, we at 15 miles from Eastlan opened upon a view as in No. 75, with the appearance of a volcano to the right hand. The creek that before travelled rapidly a rocky bed, now joined with other water courses in passing through a ravine or narrow channel of great debth. We now passed over immense fields of wildest volcanic rocks that at some period had been partly fused, and thrown up in rugged masses exceeding any description; extending thus for many miles west and North. The appearance of the rocks was quite black; in places quite spongy, and resembling somewhat the heavy spray of a wild Ocean storm, thrown up in massive peaks, and pinacles, that were at  once suddenly petrified or cooled into black rocky masses of half fused granite &c. Such a field of forrest peaks and black [Schorae ?], I have never before witnessed. The government of Mexico, have cut and paved a road through this lava country at great expense, labor and time.The particulars of which they have taken care to place  upon a pedestial by the way side; whereas by passing the road (such as it was) around a few miles to the left  they might have avoided the worst peaks and ridges  of the [Schorae ?]. Some scrubb oaks high pentangular cactus,  Etc shaded the Lava road in places, until we came out upon  barren hills. No 76 shows a hasty sketch of a part of the  lava fields on our way, looking back Southeast. About  this valley, which have spread out to many miles,  many little Ranchos and villages were to be seen upon  the fertile spots, like favored places upon the  desert of Arabia. The mountains around were exceedingly  wild, and only a few of them even sparsely timbered by a  dwarfish growth, of scrubb oaks, pines, and wild cactus. This broad triangular cove or great valley, was traversed  in every direction by hills, between which were small and  fertile coves, passes, and ravines, along which only the villages  and Ranchos were located. During this afternoon we passed through several pretty villages, that were snugly hid  away in these little vallies, and after passing over   a number of rolling hills, we ascended a mountain  to the north, where we encamped at Rancho Ocott.a few hundred yards from this rancho I sketched scene No 77. looking back Southward upon that great valley of vallies, over which we had just passed; from a height of about two thousand feet. I then passed on up the road 2 miles with a friend, and from a height looking into a vast ravine of perhaps 8 or 10 hundred feet, I sketched scene No 78. looking South west. Showing two great mountains rising in a part of the valley before named; a large stream of water was leaping and bounding off from cliff to cliff down this immense ravine, the sound of which could be heard a considerable distance; whilst it was closely shaded by tall timbers, that rose up the steep sides of the abyss, near to its summet edge. During this day we have seen back in the valley several fine falls of water from 5 to 60 or 70 feet, very suitable for mills but not improved. Along this deep ravine there are fine locations for such purposes. From this place Northward the timber for many miles became very large and plentiful; with large Oaks and pines in particular. During this afternoon Mr Slaight and Mr Jones two of our company were misled upon the wrong track, which caused some fears as to their safety, but both came into camp just  before dark.It is highly important that companies should keep compact whilst crossing the Mountains of Mexico, as those who stray off, are liable to be cut off by those who constantly watch such opportunities in the  trail of the large parties who may cross their country  April 8th  Day warm and clear. During this night individuals well known, left our camp by night, and proceeded forward at full speed, 16 leagues to Tepec, in advance of our train, in order to Secure passage up to california for themselves exclusive of our company should there not be room for all. This was showing their nature horns and all, for which they afterwards doubtless sorely repented, as certain of them had before promised to remain by each other through to California. The remainder of our company proceeded as usual not at all pleased with the rush for passage, almost every Mexican  returning; when asked, gave us different reports about the chances of passenger from San Blass up to San Francisco; and we could ascertain nothing very definite and but little that was encouraging. Some telling us that there was but one vessel in port which could take but four or five more passengers and prices very high, with poor accommodations; others,that there were several vessels in port, and others that there were none that could carry more passengers, and thus the reports varied, but the remainder of us thought best to take things coolly and as they might come; which afterwards proved to be to our especial advantage at Mazatlan. Proceeding northward on the Summet of the mountain on  which we had just encamped, we passed through much large and valuable oak timber. During the morning, I  sketched No 79. which includes Norelio Mountain, as seen  at the distance of about 10 miles to the northward, being also within full view of the town of Tepec to which we were bound. About an hour after sketching the former, we commenced descending a graded road down the mountain,  a part of which I sketched as in No 80. after which we  crossed a fine creek, then passed over and around a number of wild hills with but few scattering habitations, and those of the poorest kind until we came out upon the open woodless hills, that were beautifully rounded and moulded as by art, and only covered by parched prairie grass, and  ranging thus at random around the base of the great Novelio Mountain, whilst sloping off gently in an extensive valley, which was walled in on the North, East, and South by formidable mountains.Again, we ascended a small ridge, which soon gave us a fine view of the great valley of Tepec. We continued descending for Some time upon rolling hills, very sparcely timber with here and there patches of Scrubb oaks, cactus, etc. within about 6 miles of Tepec. I took sketch No. 81. [showing] showing the appearance of the country around that beautiful town. And before entering the town within about a mile and a half I took sketch No 82. showing a fine Stonebridge plastered, and of neat construction; on the principal road to Tepec. This road is generally broad, though not agreeable for [?] vehicles of any kind and is likewise well supplied with fine dust, which during (this) the dry season is almost intolerable during a windy afternoon. Our company arrived in Tepec at 3.O. clock. P.M. a band of dusty travellers, with long beards, jaded, and all the usual et ceteras that attend such a long journey and more especially in Mexico, but not yet closing our journey through this peculiar country. On arriving we ascertained that those preceding us to Tepec had engaged passage up to San Francisco upon a schooner of about 30 tons, that was said to be unfit for service. They paying 70 dollars, and find themselvesbesides being compelled to sleep upon deck; and even at that thinking themselves lucky in getting the chance, at the same time chuckling at us, whoom they considered unfortunate; in not having a chance to sail from San Blass, and at the same time telling us that they pittied us, as we must evidently remain somewheres in Mexico possibly for months to come. But believing that from the greater importance of Mazatlan as a sea port, and place of business, we concluded after resting a day in Tepec to proceed thither, although it was yet another week's journey, the result of which will be seen greatly to our advantage. April 9th  Day warm and clear. In company with a friend (Mr. Sayre), I proceeded this morning at an early hour, several miles out of town upon the summet of a neighboring mountain; (it being a day rest for our animals &c) from the heights of which, an extensive and most beautiful view opened in every direction To the east we saw the lofty peaks of Novelio mountain, and very many of those pretty woodless, and grass covered egg shaped hills before mentioned. Far beyond which formidable mountains reared their misty shadows in dim outline high upon the horizon, upon which the morning's sun had already arissen in his glory amid flitting clouds. The South, thesome great chain of mountains ranged with their many lofty peaks; South west a beautiful valley continued for miles,  with a high mountain ranging west of it. The same mountain  approaching to within a mile of our peak, fell off abruptly  and a valley turned around at right angles with the  former, ranging off into red hills, towards the Pacific Ocean. An extensive and magnificent view broke upon us from  the North, which I endeavored to sketch as in No. 83. North East were seen mountains and peaks piled upon  mountains, many of which were seen far above the mists  and detached clouds of the morning. Here the country  descends rapidly upon the Pacific plains, which are  nearly two days journey from Tepec. The plains could  be seen far on the dim horizon but not the Ocean. This scene was extensive and grand beyond description. To the north and several hundred feet below us, there was  a circular lake of water, No. 84. partly covered with  green rushes, and edged by high walls of rocks, being rugged  bluffs of dark brown rocks, in places covered with a red soil. This lake was nearly round, and elevated several  hundred feet above the valley of Tepec, and exhibited  all the signs of having been at some period a vastcrater to this volcanic country, but now filled up  with water. We then descended into a deep ravine, at the  foot of the hill (letter A) No 84. Through which a fine large stream  water descended rapidly upon a rocky bed. Near the foot  of hill A. is located an extensive cotton factory belonging to Mess  Forbes & Co. as in sketch No 85 .and sketch No 86. taking  two different views of this handsome establishment. The proprietors I believe are Englishmen. Their garden  of Bannanas, Plantains, Oranges and other tropical fruits, is extensive, and exceedingly beautiful, and  more to the idea of some Hindoo scene than one in Mexico. The whole scenery about this factory is  pretty, tasty and romantic. This establishment does  an extensive business. We returned to town by 2.O. clock P.M. after which I sketched the interior of our  Mason (No 87.) or public house, which was tastefull constructed;  our quarters however were not as agreeable as the  appearance of the place. The church on the plaza was large  but of an ordinary appearance, and another similar one  in the town, but a very handsome one of smaller dimensions  1 1/2 miles from the plaza, which time would not  permit me to sketch, and attend to other duties.A hasty sketch of the plaza was also taken as in No 88. It was surrounded by large shade trees of the oak; and in the centre of it there was a pretty fountain of a plain but neat appearance. The plaza was almost entirely surrounded by colonade rows of usually two Story Stores of the first class. The streets of the town ran uniformly at right angles; were clean, and well paved; the same at Gaudalaxhara, the towns of Logos, and San Louis Potosi, etc. The rooves of the houses were uniformly flat, generally one story in height, frequently whitewashed, or neatly ornamented with various colors. But the suburbs of the town, as usual for Mexico, was surrounded by small mud cabins which so much destroys the good effects of Scenery about the Mexican towns, villages, Rancho's etc. At Tepec, we met another American party, and here also 10 of our company left us in order to proceed a distance of 60 miles to San Blass, and from thence embark upon a vessel they had never seen, which afterwards proved to be unseaworthy and landed them some 9 or 10 days afterwards at Mazatlan in (distress and other) difficultiesWe had remonstrated with them however at Tepec, and there they considered their chances much superior to ours. [*April 10th*]  Day warm and clear. Left Tepec at an early hour, and proceeded through a northwest pass, among red hills, little coves, and small narrow and fertile vallies among Shady groves, palms, Bannanas, Plantains, Oranges, &c. and when plenty of watermellons could be  obtained very cheap with other fruits, this region of the country appeared well setled with neat and Shady Ranches, and well supplied with running streams of water. Many farms here appeared like little paradis's for shade romance, and the comforts of life; and many were the  varied scenes of this [day] morning that were really captivating. [except] But in the after part of the day upon the planes, having descended upon a warmer country, we were  open more to the sun, and much annoyed by dust. In making our grand descent upon the plains, we passed down over a long rotine of rugged hills, that gradually diminished as we descended, being sparcely covered with large Palm trees, some underbrush, and now and then parched, prarie grass not of much interest. The view however on descending was extensive, as in sketch No 89.Having descended upon the Pacific Plains, we were  again in a much warmer climate. We again passed from the dull monotony of timbers upon the mountains when such may be found, to a lower country where a large variety were daily presented to our notice. We now saw Palms in great abundance, large oaks, the Banyan, Beach, some cedar, large cotton bearing trees, tropical fruit trees plentifully, with many whose species were unknown to us. We passed several small villages on the planes, and a number of Ranchos. Enormous trees of a species with which I am not familiar, but resembling the mulberry somewhat in shape  and leaf, and in other respects the Beach tree, grows by the road side in many places, and being dense for spreading and of very great magnitude, it frequently gave us an acceptable shade; during our travels across the planes. These five large shade trees, are however not too abundant, and by seeing them in the distance I frequently judged our distance from a Rancho; as they are favorite trees on these planes. This afternoon we crossed two almost dry beds of wheat when flush were called rivers, but not of great magnitudeOn this days route fruits, Mellons, etc, were plentiful and cheap. 16 Bannanas for 6 1/4 cts or a Madeau, A fair water mellon for a Madeau (6 1/4 cts) 1 madeau for a dish of beans stew'd with some meat. 1 madeau for 3 boiled eggs, and 1 madeau for 4 or 6 tortelias or corn cakes; As we had found it on the other side of the Cordilleres, we also experienced here; high prices in Scarce and barren places, and cheap things where the soil was good, well settled, and fruit groves, etc, consequently to be found. About 3 O. clock P.M. our train halted for the night at a Rancho 33 miles N west of Tepec which I sketched as in No 90. The water of a neighboring creek being warm, a part of our company were in to bathe. During this night Mr Davis (who joined us some days back) was scalded by the accidental overturning of our large camp kettle, in which was stewing a fine mess of chicken, supposed to have been done by wolves, that were heard about just before I was on duty as one of the Sentinels from 12 to 2 and several times, heard the wolves, Mr D was not badly scalded however. [*April 11th*]  Day clear and hot. Commenced our march at an early hour, and soon forded a broad and very rocky creek, and during the morning passed through several acceptable woodland groves.Passed a number of ranchos where fruits &c. were plenty and cheap; and the country now generally quite levil. About noon, we came upon the broad sandy beach of a river. Our saddles, baggage, &c. was conveyed across in small boats, (canoes) whilst the whole drove of our animals swam the river together. The scene was  interesting and having a few moments (after just finishing a fine large water mellon) I sat down and  sketched the river, Mountains, &c., as in View No 91. The mountains were still in view; and follow upon our right, all the way to Mazatlan, as we are now persuing our way up the coast, though not yet in Sight of the Pacific Ocean. This river which we have just now crossed (I was told) is called the \"Rio San Diago\", being about 18 Mexican leagues from Tepec, or something over 50 miles. Having crossed the River, whilst the mules was reloading &c. for our further progress, most of our company went into a town nearby (of some size) and refreshed themselves upon fruits, coffee, chocolate, eggs, &c. etc. The town though of good size, was dilapidated and of an ordinary appearance, though commanding apretty location. Persuing our course over a very dusty road that wound hither and thither upon a levil country of brushwood and larger clusters of timber, we passed through a village of perhaps 40 or more houses, all entirely deserted, except one, which was tennanted by one Solitary man of a fierce countenance, being a cripple, who had only a few poor mellons for sale at high rates. This was rather strange yet strangely true, one man the Sole lord of a desolate village, no other Mexican was seen in the whole place, and all was closed up without Signs of furniture; the place may have fell into the hands of Robbers, or be unhealthy; we did not ask respecting it of the man, although it excited remarks in our company. This afternoon afforded but little of interest except some large cotton fields, with ripe cotton, belonging to some Ranchos, and surrounded by fences, which is an uncommon thing in this country, fences are very  rare throughout all Mexico. we travelled many hundred miles without even seeing a fence; although there may be many farms, it is not every man that has a fence, and even those who posess them mostly have very short appologies for fences, which  are rare things in Mexico,I mean fences of wood stone fences of great length, have been seen almost every day or two, amongst the settled parts of the mountains. To day we saw, as beforementioned, fine fields of cotton; but for the first time that I remember in Mexico. We also saw a wild tree about the size and shape of an ordinary apple tree, bearing large and numerous pods of the fine white cotton; And a number of curious fruit trees about the woodlands and water courses. Much of this days travels, all things considered is not by any means inviting to travellers; being dusty in places open to the hot sun, and much of the time rather uncivilized in appearance, which however is no criterion to judge western Mexico by. Before sunset we halted, after a long days march at the Rancho of \"Buena Vista\" being about 145 miles from Mazatlan. I sketched this place as in No 92. A friend Mr Custer, and I went out afar the creak near by for game, and we returned in about 15 minutes with 3 large Pheasants upon which we made a fine supper, and obtained plenty more for our breakfast, and to carry with us for our dinner, our company numbering at this time between 25 and 30. Since leaving Tepec, those for San Blass taking  another road.[*April Thorsd 12th*] Left our Rancho at an early hour. Day clear and hot; with the usual afternoon winds from the Pacific. Passed over an extensive palm country this day, gentle slopes all day covered sparcely with tall and scattered Palm trees, grass burnt off for miles in places; much wild game by the way, few habitations, and those generally of the lowest class. In the morning sketched No 93. of the lofty peaks &c. of the  Cordilleres on our night, which are always in full view in passing up the coast . About noon we again came  to the bank of another River which was partly dry, and at this season fordable, I did not ask its name, but the town of Cauponetta , was on the opposite side to which we forded. A number of Mexican women were along the margin of this river at their customary employment of  washing out clothing; one very clear trait of the Mexicans. Sketch No 94. shows, the river, town, and mountain scenery from opposite Cauponette Puebla. After refreshing  ourselves upon mellons, fruit, etc, in this pleasant town we proceeded forward at a rapid gait to finish a long days march. Much of our road was very dusty, though there was less wind than usual; our country slightly rolling and upon the night a full view of the lofty mountains of the coast.This night we encamped at a desolate Rancho a few miles beyond a river, where things had a distressing appearance we could neither obtain water or food of any importance at this place, so that most of us had neither supper nor breakfast. The appearance of everything about these few huts, was perfectly squallid, and the natives almost totally unclothed and appearing reckless and unconcerned about any thing. We camped beside the road, and huts, and kept strict watch during the night; but a few miles back, on the other side of the river we could have encamped at a small village, where all the conveniences were at hand, but being only a few days from Mazatlan, our company became very anxious to finish their land travels in Mexico, and consequently pressed each day. We missed it, decidedly in crossing the river this night, as we left a pleasant camp grove and conveniences at that place, for a desolate place where we lost two meals, and had no water either for our animals or ourselves  April 13th  Day warm and clear with a fine seabreeze this afternoon Passed through a nearly level country, covered with scattering palms; we came to a village of a squallid appearance about 10. O.clock A.M. where by much trouble we made out to get something to  eat.of all squallid places we had yet seen, this village was the climax. Here in front of a cabin, sat a wretched looking woman clothed in rags, and her feet projecting on the walk from a heavy pair of wooden stocks, where she was fastened probably for some offence. The whole of the inhabitants were almost entirely unclothed and appeared to be living in misery and starvation. Having the bold mountains on our right which were all day in full view, we proceeded onward up the coast through Palm forrests, that seem'd never ending, and towards noon oppressively hot; several crosses were passed this day; whilst this section of the country appeared very much uncivilized; and we frequently met men, entirely without clothing. A range of mountains seem'd now to range off west to the Pacific Ocean, over which it appeared that we must pass, on the morrow; approaching within a few miles of their wild and rugged base, we encamped at a Rancho called Cerauso, as in Sketch No 95. here things appeared more genteel than on the previous night and we were enabled to purchase a scanty allowance of provisions, which were in demand and highly acceptable.April 14th Day clear and hot, Left our rancho at an early hour, and proceeded along the base of rugged mountains directly west to within some 5 or 6 miles of the Pacific beach, but not in sight of the ocean, as we came upon a low ground, we passed around the end of those mountains, and travelled over flat planes covered with high grass, and in places pools of Salt water, and yet on this day we did not see the ocean, although at one time we were said to be quite near to the beach. from the edge of a Small Salt lake, I sketched some large and high rocks, which were the terminus of the mountains and nearest to the ocean as in No. 96. I had no time to ascend it, or I may have possibly first beheld the Pacific from its Summet. Again we appeared to direct our course inward from the coast, which brought us in the afternoon to a broad river, with wide beaches of sand and gravel. This stream we forded and entered the pleasant town of Rosario as in sketch No. 97. The location of this town with its mountain scenery was very pretty and interesting. Fruits of every kind with fine mellons were very abundant and cheap in this place. The churchwas large, antiquated, but of handsome finish; up the river about two miles and upon the opposite side, there appeared in full view a similar building of great magnitude, and from its colors and peculiar structure appearing to be much superior to the building in Rosario. Mountains of great magnitude were from 5 to 10 miles to the eastward. In the afternoon we left this pleasant and populous town, and persuing our way among gently rolling hills Palm groves, and vast tracts of brushy oaks, Bodock trees & we encamped at a village of a genteel but  odd appearance; where provisions were plenty, and cheap, and the inhabitants quite friendly. Oranges, mellons &c plentiful. April. 15th  Day clear and hot, persued our course at an early hour, travelling the same routine of plains, rolling grounds, gullies, Palm forrests, &c this day we passed through many miles of Bodock trees, which much resembled an orchard of civilization, extending, far beyond the reach of the eye, with many thousands of bushels of large Bodock apples; I have no doubt but that in time, the seed of these trees will be sought after  for making hedge fences over countries where timber may be scarce. At noon we passed through a fine large townand stopped for a time to refresh ourselves at the market plazas; immense quantities of watermellons were seen in every direction; Soon a large congregation of Ladies, Gentlemen, and civilized looking people came pouring forth from a  large and antiquated church upon the plaza; and people quietly on their way to their houses, though viewing our company with some little surprise and attention. From this town we persued our way over \"slightly rolling\" country of Palms, oaks, and in places a variety of timbers and encamped at night as usual at a rancho. April. 16th Day clear and hot. Persued our journey at an early hour being in full view of Mountains all day, sometimes among hills, and at others upon plains of Palms or extensive groupes of underbrush, with scattering trees of magnitude. The mountain Scene No 98. was sketched this afternoon, from the summet of a Small hill. during the day we passed over several open praries and at night encamped at a rancho of a respectabe appearance beside a fine stream of good water. April 17th Day clear and hot. Persued our journey at Sunrise in order to reach Mazatlan this day. During themorning our road wound considerably amongst small hills, and was sparcely timbered with some Palms, Oaks, &c during the whole day, except where Salt lakes had left level planes of Sand, with not even vegetation Sometimes for miles in some directions upon one of these sand beds, I witnessed to day, what is called mirage, or the deception of water, ahead. For some time I supposed that we were coming to the margin of a lake whose waters were troubled into waves by wind, but on approaching the same, I discovered the mistake; by discovering that the heat of the Sun caused a mist to arise from the sand, which by its position and  reflection to the eye caused the deception called mirage. about noon we arrived in the old village of Mazatlan distant from the present Sea port of Mazatlan, about 24  miles. At present it is a place no importance, and is much dilapidated; we obtained some fruit here and proceeded on our journey to the port of Mazatlan, before leaving this place I sketched the ruins of an ancient church at one corner of the old village Square as in Sketch No 99. Shortly after leaving this place we forded a river, and persued our course over a level ground towards the Pacific OceanSketch No 100. was taken 15 miles from the Port of Mazatlan. Those hills on its back ground are along the Pacific, and several of them stand out in the Ocean. The foreground is a Sandy plain, on which at w, I thought I saw the lake of water, which as I was very thirsty at the time, appeared quite acceptable, and after taking the sketch, I dashed away full speed with my horse, to reach it with the company, but it proved to be a very complete deception of water. Approaching within 8 miles of the Pacific, we came to the bank of a Salt lake, which I sketched as in No 101. showing the distant hills near the port of Mazatlan. At 6 miles I took another sketch as in No 102. whilst we were passing around the Salt lake. The fresh breeze was fanning us from the pacific; the declining Sun was shedding his gentler evening rays upon us from over the hills of the Port of Mazatlan, as we wound our way around that pretty lake before named, and crossing the flats, we arising suddenly upon a high ground came at once in full view of the long sought for port of Mazatlan, and for the first time a broad and beautiful view of the Pacific Ocean, its islands, shipping, and its foaming  surfs that chased each other rapidly upon the pretty beach before us. What a captivating view; two great objects at one view, the Pacific, and the port of Mazatlan  with also the gratification of now closing our land,  journey across Mexico, and again embarking upon the  mighty waters of the Ocean; and thus ending the second great chapter after leaving Philadelphia, and about to  enter now upon a third important change. All  the past toils were passed over without a murmur, when arriving here, none would of course return by the same way should such ever offer, but none were sorry that they had encountered the toils and fatigues of this journey when they knew it had now closed by land, and was about to commence by Sea; and all were of course well pleased and quite merry on entering the town with their prospects of soon being at Sea; and done with Mexico."
